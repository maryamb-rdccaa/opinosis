1,1,1,2.0,05 Nov 2017,"I was sitting on the couch and my doorbell rang. I leapt off the sofa and ran to the door screaming, ‚ÄúMy banana slicer!‚Äù  I opened the package and immediately snatched a banana to slice. Without instructions included I did not realize I had to peel the banana first. It was a gooey mess and I had to grab another. This time I peeled it, but my banana was too small. It didn‚Äôt fill the whole slicer.",L. Wurts

3,3,3,2.0,09 May 2017,"My expectations may have been a little high, but I have not been able to successfully slice more than 3 bananas at one time.  Not sure how Hutzler can claim to slice 571 bananas with this model.  A video demonstrating the proper technique would help.","Chandler, AZ"
4,4,4,5.0,23 Jan 2018,"This slicer is the best!  For years my household would draw lots as to who would have to slice the banana.  More than once this lead to lots of blood and a trip to the emergency room.  Now we don't have to worry about loosing a finger or an occasional body part.  Slicing bananas no longer resembles a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Thank you Huzler 571!  If only we'd found this product sooner my wife would be able to wear her wedding band on the correct finger and junior wouldn't be known as ""3 finger Jack"".  Better late than never I say!",Michael J. Corkren
5,5,5,5.0,03 Mar 2011,"For decades I have been trying to come up with an ideal way to slice a banana.  ""Use a knife!"" they say.  Well...my parole officer won't allow me to be around knives.  ""Shoot it with a gun!""  Background check...HELLO!  I had to resort to carefully attempt to slice those bananas with my bare hands.  99.9% of the time, I would get so frustrated that I just ended up squishing the fruit in my hands and throwing it against the wall in anger. Then, after a fit of banana-induced rage, my parole officer introduced me to this kitchen marvel and my life was changed.  No longer consumed by seething anger and animosity towards thick-skinned yellow fruit, I was able to concentrate on my love of theatre and am writing a musical play about two lovers from rival gangs that just try to make it in the world.  I think I'll call it South Side Story.",SW3K
6,6,6,1.0,16 Jan 2016,"I can't believe this slicer is listed as ""great for cereal."" I tried slicing Cheerios, Trix, Corn Flakes, and Chex, and each ended up crumily smashed, not neatly sliced. What's worse, this thing is nigh useless on Cream of Wheat.",Comet

8,8,8,5.0,04 Nov 2015,"I knew my kitchen junk drawer was missing something. It has the usual obscure utensils-ice pick, meat hook, those little corn cob sticker things-but it opened so freely. I knew this was unacceptable for any kitchen junk drawer. I needed that one big thing that would barely fit in and would snag the counter every time I opened it. The Hutzler 571 was perfect! Now my drawer snags like every other junk drawer I've ever had and I have to push the Hutzler 571 down with my hand to get it open. Plus when I need 16 pieces of a banana it does the trick. Nothing worse than 9 small slices and 7 big ones on your cereal. Thanks Hutzler 571!",J. Huffman
9,9,9,3.0,25 Apr 2018,If you‚Äôre only slicing two or three bananas it might be less work to slice them with a knife than to clean this afterward.  The banana pulp sticks to it so it‚Äôs not a quick and easy clean.,Peach pie

11,11,11,5.0,19 Nov 2018,"If you are ever worried about having to go back to the tedious chore of slicing bananas with a knife, fear no more! The Hutzler 571 banana slicer will never fail you, even in a power outage! If you are worried that your sliced banana presentation is sloppy, this is the tool for you- uniform slices every time! Although it tends to sit idle more often that not, it gives the ambiance of my junk drawer a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" that's essential for a junk drawer that will impress everyone. It doubles as a cat scratcher, so I'm never worried about how much I paid, since it does double-duty and earns it's investment back in no time! Glad I purchased the Hutzler 571- you can't go wrong with this little tool!",Xenia
12,12,12,5.0,30 Dec 2018,Ive always wondered how to get that professional restaurant quality slice.  Now i can !  No more paying for those expensively sliced  fruits- i can just stay at home.  Considering selling banana slices to my neighbors now for active & passive income !,Nosh
13,13,13,5.0,14 Aug 2018,"As someone who eats ~10 bananas per week in smoothies, I feel the pain on laboriously slicing up the bananas.  This product is a huge time saver and works like a charm! The blades are thin enough to slice right through without mushing the banana and the curve is just the right angle for most medium to large bananas.  Cannot beat the price as well! Stop wasting your time slicing bananas the old fashioned way and get this product!",chris
14,14,14,5.0,15 Sep 2016,"I might have never knew my meaning of life without Bananas. I can't afford sharp knives so using a blunt one is a plague for any banana enthusiasts. I would wish for something to cut bananas from my family, but my family was too poor to afford such luxuries. I would go to countless bars to forget the constant pain of not being able to cut the yellow fruit. It even got to the point where my sister wouldn't bring her children to our family's Thanksgiving events because the children were to scared of my banana induced rage. My wife would always put up with my banana depression and left me; 14 years married and she had put up with everything. My will to even get out of bed had affected my life. ""If only I could cut my Bananas!"" I would yell in the streets. It wasn't till a saint, my guardian angle, my neighbor Darrel Dinkle, had told me about this amazing creation called the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I wasted no time to obtain this treasure. Now my depression of bananas had been cured! Now I can cut the yellow skinned fruit that God had created for mouths to enjoy. My life couldn't be better; I've even started to go around the neighborhood to share such invention to the neighbors to spread the glorious Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers.",Amazon Customer
15,15,15,3.0,21 Feb 2018,"Great idea! Great for children in cutting up bananas for snacks or cereal and parents not having to worry about knives and their children cutting themselves. So if you are a parent and want something your children can use safely in cutting bananas this item is the real deal...but if you are looking to air/freeze dry or prepare bananas on a large scale for food storage, camping trips, or etc...this item is clearly not for you as its Very Poor in both design and quality. I have no issues with the item being plastic (again great for kids and safety issues) but for adult uses there are significant design and performance flaws. First, the internal so-called plastic edges are nowhere sharp enough to make clean multiple banana slices. Second, as one knows bananas have a high degree of stickiness and hardness if one doesn't remove the residue immediately after use. (Dishwashers won't even remove banana residues even on metal knives). So if you leave the banana residue on the slicer for any amount of time you have to place it under hot water and scrub each plastic edge to clean it...very time consuming. Third, the design looks fun and simple to use and as I said for kids and small to mediums banana a fun and nice product but for larger bananas its just doesn't work unless you first cut the banana in half. So in closing if you want this for your kids it gets 5 STARS for cuteness, fun and safety, but if you want this for any type of professional or large banana cutting I would give it a 0 STARS...thus three stars. I should have read the item details closer. So my fault in buying it for why I needed it. I guess I was a kid for a moment and loved the concept. :-)",Douglas R. Lyon

20,20,20,5.0,12 Oct 2018,It works really well to slice bananas.. After slicing I put them individually laid down on a piece of press and seal lined cookie sheet. Freeze them and Wallah a nice thick banana smoothie! A good invention. Kind of cheap but it does the job,Gail
21,21,21,5.0,04 Dec 2015,"I have said it once and I will say it again: there is nothing more infuriating than an improperly sliced banana.

29,29,29,1.0,15 Dec 2019,"I don't know how they expect anyone to use this device without an instruction guide. It's just too complicated. Where do the batteries go? Where is the USB port?  There isn't even a user pdf available for download.  Fortunately, we were able to complete assembly on our own based on years of IKEA experience, but good luck to the novice. ""Banana Slicing For Dummies"" was also a helpful resource, but we really expected not to have to spend $49.99 on a book. In any case, the device doesn't include bananas, so the advertising is deceptive. One alternative is a $5,000 high quality 3D printer and software to print your own banana slicer. The ""flip horizontal"" function will allow you to print versions for bananas that curve left and for those that curve right. This is a more useful option for the serious banana enthusiast.",J.

47,47,47,5.0,15 Jan 2013,"When I was a small child eating a whole banana was an embarrassing, soul-crushing experience. Bananas are so large, and my hands were so small. As I grew, my hands never really became adroit at holding a banana, a pickle or any long smooth items, regardless of girth. Thicker made it more difficult. One day, when I was about 17 someone suggested that I slice the banana and try eating it that way.  I was confused. Did I slice it like a ninja with a sword? Did I hold it with one hand and cut into it and let the pieces fall into my lap?  Finally, I decided to lay it on my leg. As soon as I held this massive long yellow object on my leg I began to get nervous. Nothing that long and thick had ever been on my leg before. My hand shook. My heart raced. I became flushed. As I went to cut into the banana I blinked nervously, and the knife cut just the tip of the banana, but it also took off the top of my thumb and plunged into my leg. Laying there in the hospital I thought I would never be able to enjoy the sweet goodness everyone else loved so much.  Thanks to this wonderful Godsend, I can now slice my bananas and smile as I lay that sweet slice in my wet mouth. Oh the joy. The ecstasy. I finally feel complete, despite the limp.",Reviewer X

I pulled out the 571.  I felt empowered. I felt emboldened.  I felt alive.  I picked up and peeled the banana, and used the Hutzler 571 to cut slices. The slices were perfect.

The old cleche of ""is that a  banana in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"" is the kind of mockery I will forever avoid as I now handle my banana in private at home and show up to work with a tupperware full of delicious banana slices.

69,69,69,5.0,02 Feb 2014,"Before I purchased the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, my life was dark. No anti-depressants, or psychotherapy could penetrate the deep, dark fog brought on by my complete lack of ability to slice a banana into equal pieces. I tried several different therapists, and a host of medications, both prescription and health-food store quality OTC's. Nothing helped. Knives, rulers, harps, ceiling fans, chipper-shredders, and my OCD concerning banana slicing, was driving my family to the brink, and the sheer horror of having to peel the banana and bite it with my teeth was destroying my ability to function in polite society. I made my plans to build a tiny house and live off the grid. I was dropping out of my life, and my potassium levels dropped to a dangerous low. But, while perusing Amazon for a tiny washing machine to place inside my tiny house, I came upon this little, life-altering gem. Now, with normal potassium levels, and with my OCD manageable again, I can finally give up living ""off-grid"" and retire, living in my McMansion, and filling it with craptacular items purchased from my local Wal-Mart. How lucky can you get? My relatives are already arguing over who gets this marvelous contraption upon my demise. Won't they be surprised when they look into their Christmas stockings next year?

73,73,73,5.0,29 Jul 2017,"Have you ever tried to slice a banana on an inter-galactic spaceship? I had to hide the embarrassing manual process--banana in hand, knife in the other, atop the galactic map counter, hacking away at it... I was a basket case until the human relations AI Balthazar ordered for me the Hutzler 571 Banana slicer. When the Amazon drone--what spectacle that was!--dropped in on the ship just before we went into FTL flight, my confidence, and thus standing with the crew changed dramatically. After consistent and systematic repeated use of the Hutzler banana slicer--the plastic held up beautifully during the wormhole passage--I was catapulted to ship's captain. I went from hiding with embarrassment in my dark, little bunk to sitting pretty in the captain's chair on the bridge. Like a god! To say nothing of the BIG cabin and fantastic glam uniform with lots of gold and ribbons. Now I face the galactic powers with confidence. When encounters get tough, I whip out my banana slicer and show those snooty Zdas with way too many beady eyes my prowess with the banana slicer. And they simply fold in whimpering terror..",Aeneas

81,81,81,4.0,26 Feb 2014,"I was so excited when my Hutzler 571 arrived I could hardly contain myself.  It shipped in a padded envelop, and on inspection there were no scratches or signs of mishandling I often see on other banana slicers I've ordered.  The build quality is acceptable given the price point.  Of course I own a full set of silver banana slicers for use on special occasions and frankly this is no match, but if you want a simple/no-frills banana slicer that you're not afraid to let the kids practice with, then this model is a decent compromise.  It's much larger than it appears in the picture -- so much so that you could easily slice two average bananas at once.  This was an unexpected bonus, and something Hutzler should more prominently advertise.  The resulting banana slices themselves are a little on the large side which really took some getting used to, but given the efficiency of their dual-banana technology I think this is a fair trade-off.  The one complaint I have is the manual - or lack thereof!  I was left to search the web for videos, and had to reverse-engineer the banana slicing process.  Although I managed to get it working properly in the end, many may not have the patience required for this.

Simple enough to slice a banana, but still cut throat enough to interrogate at Guantanamo Bay, the 571 does it all! I only wish I hadn't waited so long to make it part of my life.

For those of us with severely curved bananas, the advertising for this product is misleading; it is actually a two-person operation to slice such a banana. While one person carefully straightens the stiff banana without fracturing it, the other person applies pressure to the top of the Hutzler.

While it may seem like a simplistic product that even a toddler could create, it is much more than that. This is innovation. A fellow friend of mine discovered this product and it has done nothing short of change my life. You might be saying, "" This is a cheap piece of plastic with zero purpose."" Well im here to tell you its much more than that. A cheap piece of plastic is a lego.... You get a box of 3 billion of them and they expect you to figure out how they fit together. um no..... not happening. The HUTZLER 571 is happening. You don't have to worry about making the banana fit because it doesn't, you just make it work. That's how good of a design they have created. Simply flawless. So if you are looking to get ""Turnt Up"" on your average weekend night, this is my recommendation of a good time! This product is America in every way, so pay the two dollars. Its two dollars of fun that keeps on giving. ;) So heres to the product of the year, THE HUTZLER 571. If you are questioning what happened to the other 570 models, then don't.

Using the variety of products that I've ordered off of Amazon.com, I thought I was coming close to a working solution with my Syma 107 helicopter, but it was tricky.  You have to have the chopper running on your kitchen countertop at about 50% throttle with you leaning over it.  Now drop a pre-peeled banana downwards at the same time you mash the gas.  If all works well, at the moment just before the chopper begins to take flight with the rotor blades reaching their peak velocity, the banana drops through them and is perfectly sliced.  You must release the throttle rapidly upon completion of the slicing or the chopper will shoot sideways across the kitchen and embed itself into the wall.  Needless to say, some technique perfection was required, and if you miss dropping the banana into the blades, you risk having the chopper shoot straight up at you and whack you really good in the face.

This would send me into a panic attack and I would usually cut 3 or 4 fingers making the next attempt at a slice.

Months ago he had shown a picture of it on his Facebook page with a caption reading, ""This is the best thing ever invented""..  I thought he was joking as he has a really cool and slightly off-beat sense of humor.  Seeing that I'm the crazy, but silent one, I thought it would be so funny to buy it and send it to him anonymously.  No one would suspect ME of doing anything like that and it would be so much fun watching him try to figure out who would send him an anonymous package with a banana slicer inside.  HE LOVED IT!  With great timing, the package arrived on a day where he had just spent a few hours at the emergency room for a badly sprained ankle. He was in lots of pain and depressed about the day so, finding a package when he got home was a little boost. His wife took a picture of him holding it and  put it on his Facebook page!  It was soooo funny reading the story of his crappy day and seeing a picture of him holding up his anonymously sent banana slicer, especially knowing that I was the one who had sent it to him!!  In the comments section I slyly asked ""what the heck IS that thing in the picture"" and he told me all about how great it was and that I should really read the reviews on Amazon!!!  LOLOL, that was a month ago and he still has no clue it was me who sent it.  This is too much fun. I'm going to keep this up for a long time!  Just hope he doesn't read this review!

Our arguments over who had to slice that crescent yellow fruit were epic.  The confrontation grew so large that, as an adut, she moved to the coast to avoid further disputes.

159,159,159,4.0,02 Jan 2011,"Although my review does list quite a few flaws, this is a great little gadget. It does have a few things that could be improved on. The slices are a little thicker than I would normally cut myself. Only one side of the slicer is meant for cutting, and it's not always the correct side that matches the curvature of the banana. When you press down on a banana, it usually doesn't go all the way through, so you have to flip it over and push each banana piece through. And lastly, it's hard to clean out the little nooks and crannies.",ZMomUtah

I placed the banana on a cutting board, aligned the slicer according the direction of the banana and pressed down. The result: beautifully cut bananas. Clean up was easy.

I ordered two, thinking I would get a Left-handed and Right-handed slicer.......... I was wrong,  I received two left handed slicers, which is ok because my youngest son is left handed, so he will be in-charge of all the banana slicing in the house from now on.  And because he is too young to use a knife this will be safe enough for him to use because there are no sharp blades.  I just hope they make a Right-handed slicer by the time he is old enough to move out, because by then I will be too old to safely use a knife, and I will be so used to having perfectly uniform banana slices that I won't want to go back to the crappy uneven slices I have had to get by with all my life.

Also, slicing bananas with a knife would take much longer than cutting with the Hutzler 571, and cumulatively, over the course of a year or so, I'll have more time for reading with the time I saved.",David C.

My only complaint, although I blame this more on the intelligence (or lack thereof) gene factor that runs through my husband's side of the family, is that it can be confused with a real banana. I woke up one morning to my ten year old munching on the Banana Slicer. Could it be its realistic appearance or perhaps we just use it so often, it's beginning to taste like the fruit it slices.

The 569 would leave stringy banana ""veins"" all over the bars. The 570 would cause the banana slices to turn brown and the kids would scream and cry when I tried to get them to eat them. The 571's Siri feature is very helpful when needing information on the history of the banana and import/export laws. The 571 also takes panoramic photos of the banana prior to slicing. I'm so glad I stood in line to upgrade. The 571 is everything they said it would be and more. It doesn't run Google Maps yet, but they're working on that.",Jocelyn B.

287,287,287,5.0,10 Sep 2014,"I purchased this product for a right-hand dominant pregnant friend who recently found herself in a terrible dilemma one early morning.  It seems her unborn baby was craving a banana for breakfast.  Unfortunately, the expectant mother was experiencing pregnancy induced carpal tunnel in her right hand which rendered the hand absolutely useless (in a related side note, she also specifically refers to this uncontrollable hand as ‚ÄúThe Claw!‚Äù from the movie Liar Liar).  How was she supposed to cut and eat this banana the Claw she wondered?  So began the process of trial and error.  The banana was ripe, so she was able to ‚Äúclaw‚Äù the fruit and bash it on the edge of the counter to get the peel to break open.  But then she dropped it on the kitchen floor on account of useless Claw, but was able to pick it up with her left hand.  After it was skinned, she attempted to use a steak knife (that she stole from a nearby five star steakhouse) with her left hand to slice it into equal 1/4‚Äù wide slices.  But her luck just couldn't improve‚Äîit was a right-handed knife! Being in a bit of an exhausted rage, she threw the banana into the a Magic Bullet and made a banana mash.  According to the mother, that‚Äôs not what the baby ordered!  I gave her the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer product the day after the incident (Amazon Prime Free Two-Day Shipping delivered in only one day!) and it solved all of her life‚Äôs problems.  The mother and baby lived happily ever after!",Matt Snyder

Before purchasing the banana slicer, I just cut the bananas with a butter knife.  My slices would not all be the same thickness and would not dehydrate in the same amount of time. The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner. I prefer 1/4"" slices for dehydrated bananas and these are about 1/2"" thick.",Nicole McDonald
316,316,316,5.0,10 Jan 2016,"I love this product, however, I find that it cuts the banana into way too many slices.. I find that sometimes I'm simply not that hungry.. It would be better if it were adjustable to maybe cut the banana into maybe 6 or 8 pieces. I can eat those easy..but 18?? I'm not sure anyone could eat THAT many pieces..

But I must tell u that this product is not as good as the reviews say it is. It is not a life changing experience, it is not a product that will save your marriage. No, sadly, it is not even a product that can get u an A in ur AP Chemistry class either. No, this is much much much more than that. This isn't a product to save your marriage, it is a product to save the human race. Before this incredible feat of scientific and engineering innovation, we were mere apes, pealing and eating our bands with our hands. Now today, I am proud to say, that with this modern breakthrough we now advance in the human evolution process as we can now eat bananas with utensils like never before. Before this product I tried using a knife, but I always seemed to slice off my fingers, one time losing 3 to a horrific strawberry banana smoothie accident. After I received this monumental creation for a simple payment of $4.06 including tax, I am glad to report that after 4 uses, and 4 smoothies, I still have my thumb and middle finger left!

Imagine then my confusion when it arrived in the mail and she took it right out of my hands and announced that she'd be keeping it in the kitchen! Crestfallen doesn't even cover it. It took a week to muster the courage but I managed to ask recently if I might be allowed to watch her play with it at some point and she said it's not a game but if I'm ever at home when she does, she'll try to remember to call me in.

407,407,407,3.0,06 Oct 2016,"I normally don't write reviews on Banana Slicers, but coming from East Germany when there was still a Stalin Made Wall between us and freedom, I think perspective is needed.  See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, ""Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords.""  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.

Its yellow plastic gleamed in the artificial light. Beautiful.

When I finally came to my senses, I got in the car (still in my Tweety Bird pajamas) and drove to the nearest grocery store. I searched every isle, on a rampage, until I found the section for right-curved bananas. I took arm-fulls upon arm-fulls of bananas until the shelf was bare... and my cart was full. I paid at checkout and loaded up my trunk with my precious bananas. Once at home, it took 5 bananas before I realized that you had to peel them first. However, I was hardly worried about the gooey mess I had made. I spent the rest of the day slicing bananas. For desert that night I made banana cobbler.

422,422,422,3.0,07 Jan 2013,"I assumed from the photos that this slicer would produce 18 uniform banana slices.  After slicing several bananas, I counted the resulting slices and found that the number of slices produced from a single round of slicing ranged from 12 to 16 slices.  I never got the 18 slices that I expected.  I had my wife try it and she got similar results.  I checked the number of blades, and consulted with a mathematician friend to confirm that the 17 blades should produce 18 slices.  Since I couldn't get it to work, I gave up on it and threw it in the drawer. Then one day asked my daughter to bring me a ruler and she brought me the banana slicer, thinking it was some sort of cool kitchen ruler.  That's when it occurred to me to measure some bananas, and lo-and-behold, bananas come in different sizes.  I measured each banana and counted the number of slices each one produced, and found that there was a strong positive correlation between the length of the banana and the number of slices produced.  Long story short, the ONLY way to get 18 slices is to start with a banana that is exactly the same length as the slicer.

I was frozen in place with fear worried that I would not be able to see the banana that I was about to slice.  Goodness knows I had hard enough time trying to get the milk into my bowl of cereal, the only thing that helped me was the familiar sound of the snap, crackle, and pop.  I was a little more than scared I would either not be able to find the kinfe to slice it with, or even worse that once found, I would drop that ever so sharp object on the cat and put a deep gash into her lovely fur and skin.",Fran

Life was short and brutal for the  primates in the savanna, easy prey for the swifter animals, and the little band appeared near extinction. But one bold creature picked up a  slightly flattened rock, and the Hutzler #1 was born! Far from perfect, this simple prototype was primarily used for cracking open  bones for marrow, but it was a start! Generation after generation began to thrive and expand, due to the  advantages afforded them by the Hutzler #1, and gradually improvements began to be made. Hutzler #7 was best used for smashing the skulls of rival primates, #42 for slicing raisins, #111 for trimming nose hair. Hutzler 352 carved decorative figurines out of casaba melons. Some saw that as a setback, but NO! Each and every Hutzler evolution was a breakthrough, not only in technology but in imagination, they all represented  drive in the indomitable spirit that makes a man a MAN! The Miracle Push Up Wonder Hutzler, the Steamed Coffee Hutzler, the Revolving Mirrored Dance Club Globe Hutzler, (# 389, 412, and 461, respectively).

My consciousness flooded with the knowledge that I have the Banana Slicer. I immediately began to meditate on it. I felt a new awareness and appreciation of all things. Cutting my morning banana was an artform.  Later in the day I began to visualize it as I went about my daily chores.

Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my ""good eater"" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his ""gratitude"" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing ""dangerously high levels of potassium"" and ""lacking in any other necessary nutrients"".

Maybe one banana at a time - same thing, no slices.  Even overnight with the banana sitting RIGHT ON this thing - no slices.  AHHH, lets try pealing the banana: it worked a little better - we'd get maybe a slice or two but the rest of the banana was stuck to the wall whenever we did not throw it accurately.  Even a pealed banana left over night did not work and leaving it all week, just left a sticky brown mess all over the counter.

My boss has already warned me about this, since I accidentally dislocated his jaw during a severe leg spazm!  So I love my new life and freedom.  I could ride horses on the beach now!

473,473,473,5.0,09 Feb 2013,"I was recently on a sight seeing tour deep in the Amazon (no relation) when I became separated from my group.  I soon became captured by a hostile tribe of natives, and was sure I was going to become that day's lunch.  I searched my pockets for whatever trinket I might find to buy myself a little time, when I found my Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.  I set up a makeshift demonstration table on a large tree trunk and demonstrated to the tribe's elders the amazing symmetrical banana slicing capabilities of this wonderful device.  fortunately for me the ancient scrolls had predicted that one day a bald, fat, white man would appear with impeccable banana slicing skills and would deliver the tribe from their shabbily sliced banana woes.  I was swept up on the shoulders of the tribesmen and immediately worshiped as a deity.  Unbeknownst to me, there had been a great division in the tribe between those who sliced bananas longways with a machete, and those who squished them up into little balls and served them that way.  I had brought the tribes together and avoided a bloody civil war.  Small children sang ballads about me.  After a few weeks, I made the difficult decision to leave the tribe and find my way back to civilization.  I left the banana slicer at the elder's doorstep and snuck away in the middle of the night.  For three weeks, I battled snakes, leeches and the occasional jaguar to find my way out of the jungle.  The worse part of the ordeal was having to survive on unevenly shaped banana slices.  I have now made my way back home and will definitely be ordering myself a second Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.",Robert Clements

I first got one in college on a dare (crazy days) and found it to be surprisingly accomplished at doing what it is supposed to, slice a bananana a bunch of times fairly equally. I had 14 roommates (those were the days) and having one made it very convenient to add a single bannana slice to each of the bowls of cereal I prepared every morning (I got a discount on my rent). Being college pupils, sometimes we could only afford the one baanana so this made for fewer fights and intentionally-dropped banana skins with the dropper hiding around the corner giggling and waiting for the hated roommate to walk by and slip. As time wore on, I tried it with different long-shaped food items just to see if it could become a flexible tool for our household, and it was hit or miss: tube of cookie dough--okay; cucumber--no way; zucchini--occasionally if not fresh; soft popsicle--a hit (take stick out first).

479,479,479,2.0,28 Jan 2013,"I used to be quite a happy fellow. I had a wonderful, beautiful wife whom I was madly in love with. I felt like I was on top of the world. But one day it all came crashing down around me. My wife blindsided me with the news: ""I'm not happy, I want a divorce."" I couldn't believe it, I felt like someone had torn the heart from my chest and implanted it into a pig and then shot that pig out of a cannon into a brick wall smashing it into a pink paste and that paste then collected and formed into all sorts of delicious pork-products which are then cooked to perfection and served to the Westboro Baptist Church. It was a very specific feeling. She finally revealed that she had been sleeping with Jim, my best friend/co-worker/guy-I-experimented-with-sexually-in-college/bro. Naturally I couldn't just let them ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after, so I plotted my revenge. For months I researched and planned the perfect retribution and waited until the time was right. I hid in the back seat of Jim's car, he never saw it coming. When he awoke he found himself bound and naked with his penis laid out on the table where me and my wife made passionate love while Jim hid in the bushes outside and watched through the window and masturbated. He didn't think we knew he was there, but we knew. Why else would we do it on the table with the curtains open if not to be seen? Where was I? Oh, right. Jim, Jim's penis, table. Jim asked what was going on and I replied with my trademark slow evil laugh as I am known to do when exacting my revenge. Then I withdrew my weapon, a 571 banana slicer. Jim pleaded with me not to but he should have known something like this would happen after helping me dispose of all those bodies. I placed the 571 over Jim's penis, which was conveniently curved to the right almost matching the 571's curve perfectly. However the slicer did not perform as expected. It's plastic construction works on the soft flesh of a ripe banana but is useless on a wife-stealing man's penis. I gave up and decided to fix myself a bowl of cereal. Several bites in I realized I hate bananas and that I had neglected to wash the slicer which was probably why my Golden Grahms tasted slightly of wang.

I had to use a mallet to overcome the stem. Very messy results. Further, it was challenging to find bananas that actually came close to the exact shape of the device. There I was at Wal-Mart for three hours trying to match up bananas to the cutter. Such a waste of time, and the store manager was quite irritated as well. I don't blame him. I did warn him that he'd probably be seeing more of this until science can at least genetically alter bananas so they will consistently grow to the proper dimensions.

495,495,495,3.0,31 Dec 2012,"This product is fine to use in an egalitarian, non-stratified society.  However speaking from an anthropological viewpoint, I must stress the importance of cultural awareness when using this product.  The product is built to make uniform slices, which is fine in America or other western european societies.  However this product should not be used in a stratified, hierarchical culture.  For example, the formation of uniform slices in a Japanese workplace could cause undue shame and stress among workers.  By giving everyone the same size, you are implying that the coworkers are of equal value.  You are lowering the status of the boss and raising the status of the employee.  That can cause one to lose ""face"" and dishonor the employer and his family.  It is a cultural slap in the face.  Unless Hutzler creates a banana slicer with moveable slots (to ONLY be used by a culturally aware individual who understands all of the nuances,) it is best to leave this product be.

I have fond memories of Model 1 A, an ingenious, if clunky (well, more ""cardboardy"", really) version of these new slicked up models.  I have to say, I love the new upgrades on this model over the 570, or even the 571A.  Really streamlined the curves and sharpened the edges.  The engineering is very precise, down to the smallest detail of removing the bananger (black booger on the end of the banana) without much loss of banana.  They have taken care of most of the safety issues as well, but one must always be reminded ""throw the peel in the trash bin BEFORE you begin to slice"". I can't wait to see tomorrow's model, which is purported to have the jazzed up name of ""572Z"", and may slice longitudinally for ice cream enthusiasts!",Amazon Customer

You see, before I received my 571B Banana Slicer I was just your ordinary man who would grip the stem of the banana peel, in  barbaric motion,  tear down (in four strips, of course) a little more than half way to get to the banana.

Virtually all political and historical records were wiped out in the great war of 2052 as to what led to the robotic uprising, but our wise elders have pieced together what they can from word of mouth and whatever documentation they can find and verify to trace back our historical roots. Our records show that a major turning point in the robotic revolution occurred when a computer scientist named Xe Zang in mainland China bought this product. Before obtaining this product he was spending 2, 3, sometimes 4 hours a day slicing bananas for his sandwiches and cereal which distracted him from his work on computer consciousness. After finding this product he freed up enough time to devote to his career as an AI specialist in computer scientist. Even worse, he shared this invention with his fellow computer science researchers in Beijing. Soon productivity in his AI department increased by nearly 200% because the scientists did not have to waste so much time slicing bananas. Not long after this drastic boost in productivity, robotic self awareness was achieved, and humanities fate was sealed. I implore you to think before purchasing this product. It is really worth saving a few hours a day of labor if it means the destruction of the human race?",Todd B
521,21,21,5.0,10 Jan 2013,"For the past 57 years, I have been eating Rice Krispies with sliced bananas.  From the first time I discovered the usefulness of thumbs, I began using a dull butter knife to slice my bananas.  After years of practice I became quite adept at making my slices more uniform but they were never quite exact.  That caused me hours of anxiety as I pondered which slice to scoop up next with my Rice Krispies.  I didn't want the last slice to be the smallest because I love bananas and I wanted by last slice to be the best.  Often, two slices would stick together and I would have to carefully separate them before scooping to see which one was bigger.  The Hutler 571b Banana Slicer makes all my slices (except those tiny end pieces) perfectly uniform.  So, as long as I get those nasty end pieces out of the way early in my breakfast, I know the last slice will be as big as my second last.  I can now eat my Rice Krispies with confidence, which means that I can eat them faster.  That, in turn, means that my Rice Krispies no longer get soggy while I agonize over which banana slice to include in the next scoop.  My therapist assures me that I have experienced a breakthrough.  After 50 years of therapy at a cost of more than $156,000 total (give or take a session here and there), it is amazing that this wonder product sells for only $1.29 plus S&H and State sales tax where required by law.

This dame had problems.  She flopped down on the chair in a way that made me jealous of the chair for only the second time that month and definitely took the prize for the most jealous I had been of any inanimate object since lunchtime.  I offered her a cigarette...she told me she didn't smoke.  She pulled out a piece of fruit I had never seen before.  It was curvy and yellow and smelled strongly of potassium which I had never thought had a smell before, but maybe potassium had never met this particular drink of juice.  She told me she needed a private dick - which is not as dirty as it sounds as its just a name for what I do and jamokes who think otherwise should take it to the funny papers.  She told me she needed it cut, and cut quickly.  I didn't do that sort of work on account of a bad time I had with a butter knife that wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer.  I walked her downstairs to Drunk Sullys which is the candy store across the street from the bar where I knew a guy.  We walked over to the bar, Sugardaddys and I found my old partner Hutzler.

Bananas may be curved in up to four different directions, left, right, upside-down-left and upside-down-right.

Then I noticed that the slicer housing was in a rough shape of a banana.  I had an epiphany and decided to try laying the skinned banana on the slicer so that its shape was congruent with the shape of the slicer and then pushing the banana ""sideways"" (vs. endwise) through the slicer.  This worked so much better and produced the nice, circular, cross-sectional slices that I was hoping to get.",True Rocker

573,73,73,3.0,31 Dec 2016,"I began questioning the validity of Scientology after purchasing this banana slicer. In my auditing sessions, I discussed my phobia of using a knife to slice my bananas. The only way to true mental freedom is to face my fears and begin using a knife. After seeing this product on Amazon I thought to myself I can finally have the peace of mind knowing that I have perfectly sliced bananas without having to use a knife. I told my auditor this and they submitted a knowledge report on me directly to David Miscavige, leader of Scientology. I was then summoned to his office were he savagely beat me for ""taking the easy road."" I was then sent to the ""Hole"" which is essentially Scientology's prison for the next 6 months. There I planned my escape. During a guard shift change I was able to sneak past the fence and run to freedom. Unfortunately, I forgot the banana slicer in my cell so I had to go back where I stayed for another 9 months. However, one night the guard on duty realized he had not finished one of L. Ron Hubbard's books which he had a lesson the next day. He ran back to his room to grab a text book. With my banana slicer in hand I was able to finally escape.",Steve Kaschak
574,74,74,5.0,02 Feb 2013,"Sure, you can slice a banana with a knife.  But then how do you transport those slices to where they need to be?  And slicing over a bowl is hazardous.  You could miss the bowl, not notice that a slice of slippery banana is on the floor, and you could slip on it and die!  Not possible with the Hutzler 571.  Once sliced, the slices are held in place ready to be transported easily to wherever your banana-craving creation sits.  Simply press down on the Hutzler 571 on the banana while it sits on a cutting board.  The slices remain firmly in the slots of the Hutzler 571.  When you lift the Hutzler 571 all the slices are held in their slots by the carefully machined sidewalls of the slots.  The micro-pores on the slots are designed to use the natural adhesive properties of the banana to grip them until you're ready to set them free.  A simple tap and they slip gently from the Hutzler 571 right where you want them.  Let's see you do that with a knife!  So if you don't want to end your life looking up at your kitchen ceiling thinking, ""If only I'd used a Hutzler 571!"" put down that knife and order one today.  Your family will sleep better knowing that you won't die slipping on a runaway banana slice.",Cycling Roberto
575,75,75,5.0,30 Sep 2012,"Well, I'll just start at the begining. I LOVE banana and avacado sandwiches. My kids love them too. I found the avacado slicer about a year ago. That revolutionized the way I viewed my sandwich. The avacado slices were even and clean cut. The banana on the other hand was a disaster. For the longest time I used my husband's axe to chop up the banana. This worked ok, except for the time the dog was trying to get the banana right before I chopped it. So long fido. Anyways, I eventually switched to using a machete. It was much lighter and safer around my two year old. One day my BRILIANT neighbor was telling me how she peeled her bananas. Genious, I thought. So another reform in my preparing my beloved avacado banana sandwich. Still, I had a long way to go. Every day I would try to achieve those perfect uniform slices for the bananas that I had for my avacados. It was still a disaster. After going through around 23 bananas trying to get uniform slices, I would chuck the bananas at the window and fall onto the floor weeping. So, my 2 and 4 year olds almost never got their lunch. They just ate the rotting banana off the window when they got hungry. My husband was really concerned about me.",Grateful

In 1960, I traveled to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to study the Kaselka Chimpanzee. My research focused on challenging one long-standing belief: that only humans could construct and use tools. While observing one chimpanzee feeding on banana, we watch him repeatedly take smaller rock, and chop the top off a banana - easily removing it from its sleeve so it could be eaten. Then, we watched him take that same small rock and cop the banana in half, and divide the banana into smaller pieces to feed other Chimps. We found this intriguing, and it seemed to imply that Chimps, while intellectually inferior in some ways, clearly were advanced enough to use tools.",Kevin K.
593,93,93,2.0,29 Jan 2013,"This product description is somewhat misleading - what it should say is: ""slice your DOMESTIC banana with one quick motion."" Wild bananas are almost impossible to kill with one slice. For those of us who prefer a more exciting mealtime experience, it is standard practice to hunt down all of our food in the wild; mindless slaughter is the best seasoning, as they say. And for the truly adventurous, Musa Ferus (or Wild Banana) is one of Mother Nature's deadliest (albeit tastiest) prey. Typically, one must stake out a Wild Banana's watering hole for several days before one even catches a glimpse of this elusive foe. It is also necessary to dowse oneself liberally in coconut musk as this pungent odor has a strangely soothing effect on the banana's normally ferocious temperament. After a Wild Banana has been spotted, one launches the hidden peanut butter trap concealed in the reeds near the water's edge, and then immediately begins pelting the confused beast with peanuts and maraschino cherry bombs. Hopefully at this point the Banana will be disoriented enough for one to safely approach without fear of attack, however many hunters have died horribly painful and prolonged deaths after misjudging the Banana's level of distraction. It will usually take several well-placed slashes of one's chocolate syrup dipped machete (the syrup obviously acting as a numbing agent) before one's foe is vanquished, and even then it can sometimes muster hidden reservoirs of strength to flee back into the wild. The point is, do not venture out into the jungle armed only with a Hutzler 571 and expect to kill bananas left and right; banana hunting can be a fun and exciting hobby, however one should never risk one's life in the pursuit of adventure without first educating oneself on the proper methodology and weaponry.",Mandy Maloon

I suffer from a terrible case of lockjaw, which ironically was caused by trying take a bite of 10 of my favorite fruit at the same time... Bananas. I was rushed to the hospital after my jaw unhinged and broke from the excessive outward force exerted by the bananas, and my jaw was wired shut. Tragically the average girth of a banana is 1 inch, and due to a genetic bone/ligament deformity the new position of my jaw would not allow my mouth to open more than .5 inches for the rest of my life. I became sad and depressed. Bananas brought me more happiness than even my wife... Which is why we got a divorce after the incident. She found out my banana-love was greater the love I once had for her. Instead of asking of asking how I was when she arrived at the hospital, she proceeded to ask ""why the f*** were you trying to shove ten bananas down your throat??"" I couldn't talk, but I had had it with her. I wrote that she wouldn't understand, nobody understands, how much I love bananas. A year passed, I lost my job because I was trying to cut bananas on my desk one day with a kitchen knife and ended up dropping it in my boss‚Äôs foot when he caught me with food at my receptionist desk. I was running late for work that day and didn't have time to cut my banana slices all exactly .45 inches. Only expensive sharp kitchen knives have the precision necessary to cut my banana slices just under .5 inches, any less than .4 inches and they would be too thin for my standards. I gathered my things and drove home to my small apartment. I began to lose hope for happiness in my life. While looking on the internet for a new job that's when I saw it: a job opening at Banana Republic. I knew it wasn't my ideal job of working for Dole as their banana expert, aka receptionist, but it would have to do.

Two months passed, and life still wasn't getting better. The place clearly had nothing to do with bananas, I did not like most of the people who worked there, and I still had difficulty eating my bananas at work. Frankly, I was going f****** bananas. It was Christmas time, and we had a secret Santa at work. I received my present from a woman who had taken a liking to me. It didn't matter to me because she didn't like bananas, but she would prove to be generous. I began opening it and was a little skeptical. I didn't want socks or any other overpriced clothing from banana republic. When I opened it I could not believe my eyes: it was a banana. But there was something else in the box, something hard, and plastic, that slightly resembled a banana. I pulled it out and that's when my life was (finally) changed forever. You guessed it, it was the Hutzler 571. I had to make sure it worked for my mouth, so I whipped out my banana ruler and measured the slice size. They were all right between .4 and .5 inches. My god.

""I AM BANANANOOKA, THE BANANA GOD, GOD OF ALL BANANAS AND RELATED PARAPHERNALIA. I HAVE HEARD YOUR CRY. I NOW BESTOW UPON YOU YOUR ONE TRUE NEED. USE IT WISELY."" He said. I opened my eyes and with amazement saw Areeb before me chewing on none other than a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. In an instant, I came to my wits and knew exactly what to do. I snatched the Slicer out of Areeb's face, flipped the switch to the patent-pending Camel Function, and proceeded to slice Areeb into 18 strangely proportionate slices. To my astonishment, the banana fell right out onto the soft sand, entirely intact. I looked to Lateef in excitement over the meal we were about to share, only to find he had been stricken with Leprosy and was no longer alive, but now dead. I nodded in respect, then thanked Banananooka. For now he had provided me with not half, but a whole banana. I then switched my trusty 571 back to Banana Function, brushed the sand off, peeled, and sliced my banana. I ate one slice, and saved the other 17 in my pocket for the long trek back to civilization. I threw Areeb's conveniently sliced water sacks over my shoulder and began the rest of my journey. When I hit the nearest village, I met the love of my life, Al-Britney. We moved back to the states where I got my current job at Camelbak, working on the new fully organic hydration pack project. We began a family and now we have two beautiful multi-racial children, Neep and Deep, with a girl on the way. We  are thinking about Reep. And that marks the end of my story. All I have to say is I would never be where I am without Banananooka and the miraculous 571 Banana Slicer.",Benjamin Martin

For the most part, Earl just sits on my sofa watching Duck Dynasty and reruns of the Dukes of Hazzard.  I go through about 50 pounds of bananas and a couple gallons of peanut butter each week supplying sandwiches for him.  Earl has always insisted on slicing his own bananas, but he often gets frustrated when he can't slice them evenly.  This usually sends him into a tantrum where he throws the bananas on the floor and stomps the fruit out of them, beating his chest and roaring loud enough to send every dog in the neighborhood scrambling for cover.  After one recent session of cleaning pulverized banana off the walls, I went searching on Amazon and found the Hutzler 571.  Now Earl is the picture of serenity as he delicately places each perfect slice on a bed of peanut butter.

However all my teeth had fallen out and my knives are very dull so I could not consume any bananas these past few dismal years.  I was inconsolable and my life instantly spiraled down, I was in a deep depression.  I lived my life longing for a purpose, monotonously working 9-5.  My boss eventually noticed how I was deteriorating physically, emotionally and mentally.  I was let go. Left without a job.  So I stayed home, mostly sleeping and crying the days away.  Eventually I felt I could not live with this burden.  That was the first time I tried suicide.  It had been slowly coming up in my thoughts for the past few weeks. After scribbling up a pathetic letter, I took 20,000 mg's of Tylenol and went to sleep, not expecting to wake back up, not to this cruel, cruel world.  However, I did wake up, in excruciating pain I know now that my organs were shutting down (that's how acetaminophen overdose kills you).  I was in the ER, not knowing how I got there until the next day.  Apparently my ex-wife had come that day to wish me a happy birthday, and to tell me that she was leaving to live with her family in Nevada taking my only child with her.  They managing to save my life, and I was put on anti-depressants.  I can't tell you if they helped or not because I did what any man would do in my situation.  I began to drown myself in alcohol.  It got to the point were I had become dependent, my addiction had become uncontrollable.  Left alone with nothing but a few hundred bucks, I was forced to sell off my belongings to feed my addiction.  Jack, Jim and the Captain were my only friends.  I had inevitably drunk myself into an alcohol induced coma.  I woke up again, in the same ER as before.  Except this time instead of anti-depressants I got detox.  The worst weeks of my life.  Delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, black outs, I had it all.  I was positive I was going to die. During one of my fevers I had lost my appetite, I could not eat anything until I saw a small bushel of bananas directly across the room.  I could not speak, as my tonsils were also taken out 2 days prior but the nurse had noticed what I was so focused on.  She brought over a banana and slowly peeled it.  From a drawer she pulled out the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer and cut my 8 uniform slices.  I ate every single one with a s*** eating grin on my face and tears rolling down my haggard face.

Of course I tried to use a knife, but the accuracy rate of getting them into nice even slices without sticking or being compressed into a completely unnoticeable shape was extremely low.

Those days are a bitter memory today -- a bitter memory, indeed. All over America, all over the world, human beings are applying pressure onto the Bananas with their Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers, pressure that can hurt, pressure THAT KILLS! More than 27 studies have demonstrated time & again that the information extracted from bananas being tortured by ""the Hutzler"" is useless! Many Bananas end up sliced and diced without volunteering a word. That's the kind of Bananas they are. Stand-Up Bananas. Sure, they'll bend -- but they'll never break. Not until the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer comes along, anyway. What happens after that is almost impossible to watch. As the poor Banana lies defenseless, stripped naked (in a vile practice known as ""peeling""), sliced, never to be seen again in one piece, the oppressor tosses the body parts upon ice cream and other innocent foods -- AND THEN EATS THE BANANA!

Having to manually slice something like 4 out of every 10 bananas you buy can be really frustrating, and I must say that this Banana Slicer has changed my life for the worse. It's like buying a car that frequently breaks down. You'll never think ""wow, this car's made my life so much simpler, with this I'll only have to walk HALF a mile to the store now instead of a full mile"".

I bought this little beauty a while back as a surprise for my wife.  Now I whipped it out one morning and did my own scientific comparison.  I got out my stopwatch and timed the two  methods  of banana slicing and here are the results.  I found two bananas of almost exactly the same length. The bananas both took approximately the same time to peel so this time cannot be included in the experiment.  I clicked on the stopwatch, took banana #1 and proceeded to cut it with a standard steak knife into pieces which, as near as I could approximate, duplicated the spacing inside the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  I used the quickest and safest slicing technique which I possess.  Voila - 19.6 seconds.  Next, I clicked on the stopwatch, took banana #2, placed it onto a paper plate and applied the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, using of course the quickest and  safest  Hutzler technique. Voila - 8.7 seconds.  So using simple Euclidean mathematics, we come up with a savings of 10.9 seconds per banana slicing with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicing System.  Now if we take the average slicing between my wife and myself of three bananas per week, we come up with a savings of 65.4 seconds per week which translates to one minute, 5.4 seconds of time saved per week.  After 20 weeks of using this wondrous marvel, we have saved 21.8 minutes of time.  After telling my wife we had a free 21.8 minutes of time for our first twenty weeks of Hutzler 571 Banana Slicing, I took her hand and we went upstairs to celebrate our new found 21.8 minutes.

When you're in the trenches, getting down and dirty (and muddy), there's nothing better than whipping out your banana slicer at the water station and enjoying a refined snack of a perfectly clean, round, sliced banana. It adds a sense of order to an otherwise chaotic day! A perfectly sliced banana just gives you the extra energy to make it through that next obstacle. Just make sure you grab a whole banana before the volunteers cut it in half and hand it to you, because they don't make half-banana slicers. By the way, it has other uses.

Not the kind of support I'm accustomed to with Apple. I guess if I stick to regular bananas it will be ok. It's a little time consuming to wash; probably it makes more sense to wait until you have at least 14 bananas to slice in one sitting, otherwise it would take less time to slice the bananas with a knife and just wash the knife.

""It really is true!  I can be 'me' again!"".  At the risk of being charged with accosting the postman, I rushed to the mailbox the day it came, ripped open the box and hurredly made my way to the kitchen.  There it lay, staring at me with mocking eyes; the bananna.  I almost let out a sneer as I made my way over and laid the Hutzler 571 on top of the now quivering bananna, and with one, almost effortless push, the ""item formerly known as banana"" lay in neat slices waiting to be consumed.  What more can I say?  I plan to order one for each of my family members as gifts, of course.  Because, when you've been given your life back, you feel it necessary to pay it forward.",EReams

I tried all sorts of cereals, most were too small and simply slotted through the gaps whilst others were either too hard or too crumbly.  It doesn't slice the flake type of cereal at all well and you may as well forget about ""in bowl"" slicing altogether.

So I thought to myself, what if I were left-handed? Since I was out of left leaning bananas, and they are the hardest to find, I had to go to 5 different stores to find one.  Once I did, I had to ask my left-handed neighbor to give it a try, sure enough it worked like a charm!

Until recently, my Hutzler 520A Banana Slicer was the first hing I grabbed in the morning after making my oatmeal. I cannot eat my oatmeal without a sliced banana. I threw a delightful fondue party and invited a bunch of friends. While we gorged ourselves on fondue, we acted out scenes from ""Bridesmaids."" It.was.awesome. I woke up the next morning horribly hungover. Horr-i-bly hungover. As I cleaned up the previous night's mess, I discovered that my Hutzler was missing. I vaguely remember my friend, Sara, taking a lot of photos of it and posting them on Instagram. Anyway, it's gone. So I ordered the newer model. I actually blushed when I opened the package. At first, I thought the wrong product got sent to me. It doesn't look like a banana. It looks like...something else. My fondue is very popular at the church potlucks and bananas are everyone's favorite dipping item. I'm afraid this newer Hutzler model WON'T be going to the next potluck. It's just not right.

My siblings and I were made fun of at school whenever we brought in our whole bananas, and that's the sort of pain one never forgets.  For years, I tried to subdue my shame by avoiding bananas altogether - banana bread, banana nut muffins, you name it.  My life changed at my 10-year high school reunion when one of my greatest tormentors brought me the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  With tears in his eyes, he handed me this most precious kitchen tool, saying, ""For years, I've regretted my banana bullying.  I know I can never take back my hurtful words, but I can make sure you never have to eat a whole banana again."" It's taken some time and therapy, but I've been able to introduce bananas back into my life.  Thank you, Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!",BananaFan01

When I first got it, I was all ""hallelujah, my knives will last longer now!"" and ""yay, no more measuring to make sure all my slices are the same thickness!"" Well, as some people have mentioned, many bananas are longer than the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I'd like to meet Hutzler one day and find out what went wrong with the first 570 versions. But I digress. Anyway, I found out if I cut the banana in half horizontally, all bananas will fit. BUT that means dirtying a knife after all to cut the banana in half, not to mention I have to use the slicer twice per banana, both of which suck, and then one day I had a recipe that called for long vertical slices of banana, and even though I tried rotating the banana and using the cutter sideways, all I got was a big dented squishy banana mess. So, three stars from me. Not the worksaver you think it's going to be during that first ""hallelujah"" moment when you open the box.",AJ

The 4.95 seemed to be a steep price at first but I couldn't believe how many of life's problems this modern marvel could fix.  Sadly two failed marriages came before I found out about this and I have no trained monkeys to work with but I had hope it could still help.  The hard part was figuring out which way to insert the banana or so I thought.  Turns out after about a hundred failed attempts you have to peel the banana first.  With out this information I ended up breaking the first six slicers I purchased.  With some inspiration from my friends wife and the peel first instruction I was still hesitant to give it another try.  I re read the 3000 reviews and decided it was worth the sacrifice.  Even though I had spent my car payment on bananas in all my failed tries and no longer had transportation to work and lost my job I decided not to be resentful for the lack of clear instructions on the package and gave it another shot.  Success,  my bananas were evenly sliced and I can eat small pieces with out having to guess about how big of I bite I took.  The rest of my life should now fall into place.",matthew hinton

The secret ingredient for the recipe would only be the tears of my younger self being burned by a cigar. Life had never been the same. I would hide in the attic at night and eat paint chips off the wall until my stomach began to churn. I would sneak downstairs to find something to eat. I was hungry. Afraid. I never knew which day would be my last. Sleeping in a dog kennel every fortnight as a child will do that to you. I began to have nightmares and augmentations of my own reality began to consume the benevolence of my putrid existence. The night sweats and midnight munchies tore away at my soul.

The blanket falls on him, and SpongeBob, not being able to see, falls off his bed and his alarm clock falls on top of his head. He falls down the stairs and the alarm propels him into the window. He feeds Gary, and comments that he has been feeding Gary snail food for years and doesn't even know what it tastes like. He tastes it, is revolted, and his screaming of disgust is sensed at the headquarters of the company that makes the snail food.

689,189,189,5.0,11 Jan 2013,"I can't even remember my life before the Hutzler 571. I was continually cutting myself, dripping blood into the cereal, and on my expensive Persian rugs. My monthly bill for carpet cleaning and bandages was well over $100. Then one day, while slowly passing out from blood loss, I accidentally pushed the wrong buttons on my bloody laptop and quite innocently came across the Hutzler 571. It may have been the euphoric state of mind induced by my light-headedness, but I ordered one immediately. In the few short days it took to arrive, my bananas all spoiled, as I was just too intimidated at this point to even attempt to prepare them the old fashioned way, knowing that at any moment my new Hutzler 571 could be on my front door step. I fantasized about going through my day without any bandages on my fingers, I even jumped the gun a little bit and took my carpet cleaning company off my speed dial. I would have so much more time to chop garlic and onions and tomatoes, now that half my morning was being given back to me by this product. Then, the magic happened...it was here! I unwrapped it with such glee that I gave myself a papercut. No big deal, I thought, this will be the last time I cut myself! I began to feel the blessings of Hutzler 571 ownership almost instantly. I can now honestly say, this is the fastest way to slice bananas! The time saving alone is worth every penny. The only caveat, I guess, is that it takes 3 times longer to clean than it did to just slice the fruit the old fashioned way. No problem! I have ordered 364 more of them, so I will have a one year supply. I just toss them out after each use. You might think it is extravagant, but no price is too great to get perfectly sliced bananas with zero blood loss. Fantastic product! I will buy 365 more next year!",Timmers in Greenwood

693,193,193,5.0,23 Apr 2013,"My name is Franz Van Boehmer, inventor of the Banana slicer.  The story of how this great product for humanity has not been told-until now. The year was 1964, a notice had been sent out to the worlds greatest scientific minds to invent products to slice fruits and other foods into perfect equally sized pieces. I was given a team of 14 men and women whose lives were about to change forever. Our first prototype was an apple slicer- since an apple is very firm and has a tough skin, we had developed a device that was powered by rocket fuel. On May 19th, 1965, we lost 5 great scientists when someone was smoking (smoking was allowed everywhere in 1965) too close to the device. Anytime I see an apple, I am reminded of that horrific day and all of the apple bits, apple bits everywhere, just a terrible thing to witness. That was the worst accident in modern fruit slicing times. We decided to move away from slicing apples (it is obviously impossible) and started to try softer fruits such as the banana.  Figuring out how to get the banana peeled was one of the most difficult problems we had in front of us.  15 chimpanzees were brought in just for this process.  Finally after 894 prototype attempts, 36 lost fingers, 5 lost hands and thousands of cuts later the product you are purchasing had came about.  We had done it, sliced a banana in a safe manner and a low cost.  I am typing this today with the one finger I have left, I have had 987 stitches and lost my left eye.  Was it worth it?  Every time I slice a banana into equally sized pieces I think to myself ""you are damn right it was worth it!""  This is what I have done in my lifetime, what have you done with yours?",Jake

He pealed the whole thing then placed the naked banana on the counter. My eyes widened as he picked up the slicer and so charismatic-ally lined up, and pressed the Banana Slicer down, slicing through the banana. After the masterpiece was finished, Tom gently picked up a middle slice of the banana and held it out to me, I carefully grasped the piece in my hand then I placed it on my tongue.

We go through about 17 pounds of bananas per day, because 1) they are as cheap as little debbie snack cakes but way more healthy and B) they look pretty in my kitchen and last longer than fresh flowers.  So anyway, because I have so many children, and am always looking for chores for them to do, this banana slicer came in super handy.  My 2 yr old uses the banana slicer to help me make baby food for the twins (5 months old.)  I was gonna buy one of those fancy smmancy baby food blenders to make mashed bananas, but this slicer was so much cheaper.  After the 2 yr old slices, I smash, and the twins eat!  The five yr old loves the slicer because she is obsessed with scissors and wants to cut everything; paper, her own hair...and recently she cut off all the blonde curls on her brother's head (the 2 yr old) so now she is only allowed to cut bananas with the slicer.  The 12 yr old uses the slicer and refuses to eat a banana the ""old fashioned way"" due to the fact that the slicer is ""way cooler than eating a banana like they did in the 90's"".....ok, that's a tween for you.  My 16 yr old is ADAMANT that he use the slicer before eating a banana because his older 18 yr old sister pointed out that he ""looked vulgar"" while eating his banana the other day, before we found this ingenious product.  So, he will only eat it if sliced by our new 571B.  And, my 18 yo daughter now uses the slicer to cut the banana for these smoothies she has been drinking every day.  She is on a new health kick, and would like to include the entire family in her new diet.  She really did surprise me though, when she pulled the slicer out of her pocket in the grocery store the other day.  We are unable to grocery shop without being stopped by 66 people who ask, ""Do you have two babies?""  ""Are they twins?""  ""Are ALL of these children yours?""  Well, one lady made the mistake of asking MY DAUGHTER if the twins were hers, and she yanked that 571B Banana Slicer out of her pocket and said, ""I oughta CUT you.""

I tossed out all of my knives - I figured the Hutzler 571 was the answer to my prayers.  I gleefully sliced bananas for everything from cereal to fruit cocktail - banana zen!  If there was a person in my neighborhood who needed a banana sliced in a jiffy, I was their man.  They could call me, day or night, and I, along with the trusty 571 would be there in a flash.  I scoffed at payment; just the look of pure delight on a wee one's face when a bowl of Rice Krispies was presented with three perfect banana slices on top of the cereal was payment enough.",No Name

I had planned to add a photoshopped picture here of the 571 with a Crown of Liberty on its top. The caption would have read, ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,"" but that would have required more work than slicing bananas the old fashioned way. The short and simple message is this: save yourself hours (imagine ten more slices than you need to make every day over a lifetime) energy and time. Need more reasons to sheathe that old banana knife? Bananas are more radioactive than any other fruit. The 571 allows you to minimize exposure before popping your treat into your mouth.

My thinking was that I would be able to eat the peel along with the pulp due to the peel being in much smaller pieces. Well the Hutzler 571, unlike the now discontinued Hutzler 565S, can not, repeat NOT, cut through banana peel.  You must, and I cannot stress this enough, MUST peel it first. And what's the easiest way to peel a banana other than using your hands? The Hutzler 570 Banana Peeler of course. Just make sure to add it to your cart as well.

The wider jaw aspect it creates completely cured her sleep apnea and now we enjoy snore-free restlful nights of sleep.  Another problem she has long endured is Psoriasis on the upper back where she simply cannot reach.

The first 2 dates were spectacular and involved horse and carriage rides, orchestras and long conversations. He had planned each date meticously and it showed. I had never met a man like this, not only was he extremely handsome, he was exuding confidence and it was apparent in everything he did. Mind you, it was'nt boastfullness, it was just confidence so strong it even bolstered me. Our third date was at a previous reviewers restaurant named The Royal Banana in Okmulgee, OK (We live in Tennessee and the date started with him flying us in his airplane to Oklahoma. Yeah, that impressive) so I knew he was getting serious. It takes months to get a reservation at this establishment, so I was awe-struck. He ordered the sliced banana on a bed of saw-grass and I ordered the Whole banana au jus. I leaned over and told him it would be romantic if he sliced my banana for me and suddenly his face changed to horror and he bolted from the table and ran away. I was stunned. What just happened? After 15 minutes of extreme discomfort, I got up and searched for him. Finally I found him in the bar in a corner rolled into a ball. After much coaxing and soothing talk he left with me. On the flight back, he opened his heart and history. It was horrible. He told be how he was born with Utensil-Impotence with a specific Cutlery sub-type. He also told me how it wasnt a bother as a child since his mother always cut his bananas and packed his lunch until he was 24. He relayed how he pulled his Ziploc bag from his lunchbox every day and told his firends he was a master banana cutter. He had hid the disability until this night. Well a happy ending.

I guess I always assumed all bananas were right handed, but when I went to begin slicing, about half of them were left handed. Now what? I can't afford to throw out half my bananas just because they curl the wrong way! I went back to the store and talked to the produce mananger about them labeling their stuff correctly, and he didn't even know there were two differnt kinds! IDIOT! Well, I won't be shopping THERE any time soon! Of course the funny thing is, when I look at them in the store, I can't really tell the difference either - but you'd think the produce manager could - how much does that guy make, anyway? Anyway, here's my question: Is there a left handed version of this product? The way the right handed one is made it certainly doesn't really look like you could just flip it over, but if I did, would that work? Would it void the warrenty or anything like that?

The gherkins simply squeezed through the slicing band without being sliced at all. Plus, some of the textural bumps on the outside of the gherkin were shaved off, reducing my enjoyment of the gherkin. Next, I tried the Hutzler on a kosher dill. I am sorry to say that, instead of slicing the pickle, the Hutzler shattered when pressure was applied, leaving yellow shards of plastic embedded in the pickle. Hutzler Inc was kind enough to replace the slicer, but they declined to reimburse me for the cost of the ruined pickle. Further, the replacement device still does not work on pickles. Having no way to slice my pickles, I was forced to use bananas in all of my pickle recipes. I will say that the bananas made an interesting tartar sauce, but they were not a hit when I used them on the hamburgers at my last barbecue. So, in sum, I cannot recommend the Hutzler 571.

Portability is everything! We are a mobile society! Glad someone at Hutzler realized this and finally cut the cord in this version! Also, carrying the 570 in the front pocket of my jeans somehow makes me feel strangely powerful. Why only four stars?

Just walk into one of our buildings and tell them what you want, and a good breakfast at a reasonable price would be yours. I was at the top of my field in the cereal production wing for 8 years, but that all began to change one day. I was slicing bananas for a bowl of frosted flakes, when suddenly I noticed my slices were uneven. I thought for hours and hours on why that might be, and before too long I realized it was because of a wrist injury I sustained during one of my drunken sprees. I was heartbroken, I didn't know what to do. At first I tried using a surgical scalpel I received from a local high school preforming dissections on cats. The scalpel was sharper than my old knife, but it was too short, and my hand was too shaky. Next, I tried using an electric razor I nicked from my barber. That didn't work either, and the noise it made scared the company pet, a rat named skittles. I went as far as to break in to a hospital and steal potassium chloride pills, hoping the customers wouldn't notice the difference in potassium sources, no dice. It was at this point my boss started to notice that my slices weren't up to par. He came into my office, beat me up, and said ""You're washed up Jonson! Now get out of my factory until you get your banana slicing back to it's former glory!"" I was walking the cold streets alone. I couldn't go home, because if my wife found out I got fired, she'd beat up the kids again. I wandered downtown, and I saw a man standing there eating a banana. The  sight of the yellow vegetable angered me, I walked up to the man with my bottle of vodka with the intent of beating him to death with it. I was a few mere meters from the man, when I turned my head and saw it, The library. I had really needed to check my email, so I let the man off the hook for the time. I went into the library and checked my email on one of their computer. I saw an email from Amazon.com, and it told me of a product recommend to me by my old scout master. That's when I saw it, The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. ""Could this be my salvation?"" I ordered it immediately, the day it arrived was the best day of my life. I got my job back, my co-workers respected me again, and my wife stopped pissing in my coffee every morning, at least she said she did.

My issue was always inconsistent slices.  One slice would be thin as paper and the next, boom half a banana.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  And again, the safety issues of other slicers are well documented probably.  I lost my right hand to one of the ""other guy's"" banana slicers.

Don't tell his parents (I think they gave it to him) but I used it a few times before our nuptials as well. Anyway, he was SO sure his Hutzler could handle anything, his banana size kept growing each time he went to the grocery. Pretty soon, I couldn't make the Hutzler fit. There would be pieces of banana sliced, mashed and mangled on the outside of the Hutzler. I started shopping for smaller bananas that would fit Hutzler. I mean, what else could I do? Well some bananas were so small, I couldn't decide, do I try to fit them all the way to the end of the Hutzler? No, they didn't bend that way. Any position I tried, there was just more Hutzler than banana. What a waste of space!! But, i made do with what i had. Then, one day, the unthinkable happened.... I was in a hurry and needed his Hutzler for a party (great for topping bananas on fruit pizzas). I admit it, I washed the Hutzler..... Mechanically... I had always tended to it by hand previously. His Hutzler got too hot and melted!! I found a friend with a Hutzler I could borrow from time to time. My husband found out I hadn't been hand-slicing bananas but sneaking around using Hutzlers wherever I could get one. Divorce! After the news was out, I couldn't find a friend who would let me borrow a Hutzler. I was desperate!! I did the only thing I could. I ordered a new Hutzler from Amazon. I admit, I hated paying for it. It was really nice to have a free one at home ready whenever I needed it. And, borrowing a friends was a hassle, all that secrecy and sneaking around. Plus, you never really know where theirs have been. I had a cousin who lost hers trying to slice a cucumber! Talk about an alternate lifestyle!! So here is my advice. Buy your own Hutzler.

After September 11th, when the world came together as one, I understood the need to ban knives on planes.  I also understood the need to ban any liquid over 4 ounces from being brought through security.  September 11th ruined a lot of things for me, but none as devastating as not being able to cut my beloved bananas on the plane and dip them in 4.12 ounces of melted chocolate.  On September 12th, 2001, that all ended.  Fast forward 12 years later when a friend sent me a link to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.

885,385,385,4.0,17 Feb 2013,"These are great reviews. I can't stop reading them...of course, I am beginning to wonder why I'm drawn in so much. The reviews are witty & all, but there is some nagging voice; some troubling mental slideshow; some feeling of something left undone. I began to dig through my important records: tax returns, masters degree, marriage certificate, college diploma, GED from Angola State Penitentiary Reform School, Prom Queen from said penitentiary...birth certificate. WAIT! That's a pretty big gap in paperwork!!! Then it hit me...it all started coming back, slowly at first and then a thunderous explosion; much like when I mistakenly pulled the wrong lever at a remote levee control room in New Orleans a few years back. But I digress. The emotional memories were overwhelming. There I was, 6th grade science fair. The judges were passing by when one of them glanced back. My hopes arose. She procured a 180 degree turn that caused her hair to almost move against the Aqua Net hair spray protective barrier for her Heather Locklear-like locks. She looked deep into my eyes...even my soul. She introduced herself, Veronica Victorio. She used her prowess to make sure I brought home the grand prize Blue Ribbon & the $5 book of McDonalds gift certificates. I was on top of the world! She contacted me after & said she wanted to bring my invention to the all mankind. She said my concept would change everything. She said my science project, ""While Swallowing a Whole Banana IS Impressive (in certain circles), Wouldn't You Rather It Sliced?"", would bring down the Berlin Wall (wow, was she right)! She opened up a new world to me. Of course, slight modifications had to be made to my brainchild. An example is the sharpened cardboard I used as blades (because my parents were not comfortable with my using knives) became a special composite that would never dull. Everything started falling apart when she wanted to ""simplify"" the name...make it ""catchy"". I revolted & was immediately rewarded with a plan that altered the rest of my life. I, unknowingly, signed away my rights to the patent in a old-fashioned chocolate malt bender that lasted for a few days & ended with me hospitalized with a pneumonia after accidentally inhaling a few too many Pixie Sticks cut with Pop Rocks. At this point Ms. Victorio trumped up charges that I was involved in a Ponzy Scheme to rip off a group of high-profile celebrities...like THAT could ever happen. That's how I ended up on the wrong end of many failed relationships in Angola. My psychotherapist/acupuncturist/ voodoo witch doctor has told me that I blanked out this part of my life and...I don't know the rest because I did not have an extra $10 to continue the session but I'm feeling better about it. I have been approached by MGM to remake my life story. My family has rallied around me.

I do enjoy the occasional banana from time to time but would always end up choking on them due to them being so long. Any banana over six inches i really cant get down my throat that far so I eventually had to start cutting them into pieces. But what to cut them with? I would scour my mothers cabinets, often leaving all of her cookware on the floor for her to clean up. I eventually came up empty handed. So what to do? I certainly wasn't going to karate chop them, as I am a professional hand model. I found myself poking around my dad's tool shed and found his old bandsaw, EUREKA I thought! This will cut my bananas down to size in no time. I decided to move the bandsaw to my room as is that is where I eat most of my bananas. But as like most things new in your life you tend to try and use them as much as possible. My banana cravings became more and more frequent. My parents finally made me move the bandsaw out of my room because I live in the basement right underneath their bedroom and they could now longer deal with the loud shrieking noises that come from a power saw. Especially since I only eat bananas at late hours because of my alternative lifestyle. Stumbling upon this banana slicer was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I don't choke on my bananas anymore and my parents an sleep through the night. The only thing i have a problem with is that the instructions do not tell me what to do with my banana peels.

But my chef knife was instantly green with jealousy. Time went on and things started happening. First, my knife literally stabbed the banana slicer while in the kitchen drawer. I found its tip buried in one of the holes of the slicer. Next, my knife just sliced my finger out of the blue while cutting strawberries. No, warning. No communication. This cut me to the bone. Next thing I know my chef knife moved out of the kitchen drawer and left for the garage. It said it wanted space. And needed to cut things like duck tape and such. I'm just at a stand still really.

891,391,391,5.0,22 Aug 2014,"I purchased this product (and I admit it, hoping that it would alleviate some OCD concerns), but found it tended to squish the banana more than cut it.  However, what it is just about perfect for is marking the banana for cutting equal thickness slices.  We dehydrate a lot of our fruits and vegatables for latter use.  Bananas pose a particular problem.  Unless the slices are about the same thickness, they do not dry at the same rate.  Trying to judge this by eye (unless you have the Mark2 eye ball modification :-) ), does not work very effectively.  With the Slicer, I just place it on top of a peeled banana and gently push down on the slicer.  It makes an indent on the banana and using the indent as a guide I then cut the banana with a knife. This is much faster than trying to cut the slices freehand and you get the uniform slices that pretty well dehydrate all at the same rate.  What to do with the ends that are not the same size? Just pop the end piece (s) in your mouth for a nice treat!",William E. Jones

The color choice, brilliant in its simplicity (yellow for a banana slicer? but of course! What were they thinking previously using flesh color, which led to so many gruesome accidents?).

In my zeal to procure bananas that best represented my substantial personal endowments, I of course sought out only the very largest and stiffest bananas.  Well, that proved to be my undoing, because the 571 just didn't measure up.  For each of the bananas, there was at least an inch or more that extended beyond the capacity of the device, which yielded clumsy end-pieces that were mangled by the faux stem of the slicer.  I warn you, unless you want to be stuck cutting up wimpy little Vienna-sausage bananas, don't buy this product until a high capacity version is made available.  I suggest that Hutzler market said device with the moniker ""Magnum"", as this has been successfully used as a marketing tool in other industries.",Szerin

All banana slices must be equal in size and shape?!?! Give me a break and not the Kit Kat kind either. (Acutally, Kit Kats are a fine example of uniformity)  Our breakfast fruit must all look the same, no room for creativity or individuality, blah blah blah. We've all heard this way too many times. If you truly believe all our fruit needs to look the same then you should also support a universal Earth uniform.  We all need to wear the exact clothing items every single day!  (may I suggest something in the blue hues as it is flattering to most complexions)  In the same mindset, we should all drive the same car, making multiple brand dealerships obsolete, needing only a one stop car store.  Of course, it might make identifying your own car difficult at large parking facilities, but the extra walking is good exercise, helping you to squeeze into the one-size Earth uniform.  The imagination could run wild with possibilities of conformity but then, that would be thinking outside the box and completely unacceptable in a homogeneous society.

949,449,449,5.0,08 Aug 2014,"One night, whilst fighting various gastrointestinal issues, I wondered to myself, ""what could have possibly caused this great discomfort?"" After pondering this question between bouts of Pepto shots and toilet trips, I realized that I did not have a balanced breakfast, which everyone knows is the most important meal of the day. Sure I had my dose of dairy, grains, meats, and sweets, but you know what was missing? Well, I did not benefit from the most important food group...bananas. I was quite perturbed at the fact that I would so foolishly skip out on the very source of life. I always have my daily dose of banana, whether it be in the form of banana pill, banana shake, banana enema, or just a good plain banana. So, what could have caused this irrational and irresponsible action? The thought plagued me and brought me to tears. Tears spawned from anger, foolishness, sadness, and an awful smell coming from the bathroom. As I buried my face in the palms my hands, I took notice at the many cuts, scrapes, bruises, and bumps covering my once baby smooth skin. My beautiful man hands were now something of horror, made so by the many years of holding the cold lifeless wilt of a knife as I tried to cut perfect banana slices. I knew then that the reason I did not have bananas that morning was because the thought of holding that cold steel in my hands was worse than the pain and discomfort I was feeling. That one night, so many nights ago, now seems like a distant dream. Once I was healthy and fit for public display, I immediately set out and purchased a Hutzler 571. Oh the joy that I now feel! My toilet has never looked cleaner, my hands never looked livelier, (in fact you see my hands in action in many mens' lotion ads...I am kind of a big deal now), and my body has never felt so young!

In addition to chores around the house and farm, that left almost no time for the pursuit of higher endeavors like hobbies, music, philosophy.  It was a dreary world back then, but a world that would someday be transformed by one ingenious invention. Who could foresee the next leap in technology.

953,453,453,5.0,28 Jan 2013,"The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has been a lifesaver for me. Several years ago I dismembered myself in a tragic apple slicing accident. Both my arms were severed at the shoulders. Ever since then, I have been forced to slice all my fruits using a knife wedged between my toes. Most inconvenient and somewhat dangerous as three missing toes clearly suggest. Bananas were the worst, though. There are just so many cuts one can make with a knife wedged between ones toes before cramps set in. With the Banana Slicer I just place the peeled banana on a plate (I am actually quite accomplished at peeling bananas with my feet) and place the cutter assembly on top. Then with a simple slam of my forehead I have perfectly sliced bananas. At least toward the ends. The middle portion gets a bit squashed and tends to adhere to my eyebrows.

It was 24 km hike down the valley to the Ace Hardware store in Mombasa. Thankfully it was the dry season and with the help of our native guide we were able to return to camp before dark.

Being a single mother, I immediately ran to the kitchen.  I unlocked the cabinet above the refrigerator, you know the one; specially made to be just-out-of-the-way enough to make it awkward to reach it, making it safe for hiding precarious items. Even in the darkness it was easy to choose and grab what I needed to help protect me and my babies. I grabbed it and 2 unripe bananas, and as I entered the living room I was confronted by 4 or 5 armed intruders. Luckily for me and my babies, I was armed with the M571B Tactical Banana Slicer (TBS)V1 and 2 bananas - which is the military grade Hutzler Banana Slicer that Happy Hubby referred to in his post. I peeled my bananas and loaded the M571B, and within 1 second, was able to dispense 15 slices and defend myself and protect my babies. As the intruders fled, I reloaded and dispensed another 15 slices.  All within 20 seconds was I able to defend myself, my babies, and my home.

I always believed it was because they were just too big for my digestive system to handle. Besides that I could never really swallow the whole banana without it causing a gag reflex. For years I have been saying if they can put a man on the moon they aught to be able to invent someway for the average person to eat a banana a section at a time. If someone would just invent a way to cut the banana into smaller pieces I dreamed. I always believed if I could just eat a banana a small piece at a time my gas issues would disappear and my dog would stay home. Then one day I saw the advertisement for the Hutzler 571 Banana slicer. I very skeptically ordered it on line and anxiously awaited its arrival. I can now honestly say that I have been using the Hutzler 571 now for several months. It's an amazing and inspired invention. It actually slices the banana into small pieces making it easier to swallow and digest. No more gas and my dog stays home. Oh and incidentally, the instruction that came with the 571 suggest that you peel the banana before eating. It recommends peeling the banana before slicing and even includes those instructions in the owner manual. This is so easy a monkey can do it.

As children, me and my five siblings would get up before dawn to harvest bananas.  All day we would toil in the fields so that by nightfall we might lay our many bushels at the feet of von Schtupplepuss.  ""More bananas!"" he was always shouting at us.  He would stand at the balcony in his bathrobe and laugh at his pathetic minions, sometimes taking a break to snort lines of sweet Columbian blow.  When the daily harvest was done, he would call upon the children to slice bananas for his own personal use.  His armed guards would herd us into a dank cellar where a pile of bananas would be heaped in the corner of the room next to a box of rusty razor blades with which we were meant to slice perfect, quarter inch pieces.  By the time I was 11, I had lost 2 siblings to tetanus and those of us who remained had a collective 23 fingers left between us.  I knew there had to be a better way, but for years we all suffered, each day more horrifying than the last. Upon my 18th birthday, I was granted an opportunity to engage in a battle to the death for mine and my family's freedom, as is customary in all Lithuanian feudal land owner situations.  I was pitted against the Baron's greatest warrior, Kerry Crankleweis.  As I entered the arena, the crowd booed and jeered me.  I bowed to my opponent and took to the stage.  A fierce battle was waged indeed, and in the end, I emerged victorious, my aggressor's head on the end of my spike.  I had not only won my family's freedom, I had also stripped Ludwig von Schtupplepuss of his land and titles.

My point is, we all went back to our normal lives.  We were still America, but where had the spark gone?  Then came the Hutzler 571.  Some say it was destiny, others compare it to the Big Bang.  However you may try to grasp the idea of the 571, it changed us, and this time it's for good. God? No. But one inseparable part of the Creator.

Usually tools for bowl turning work poorly for turning spindles and vice versa. While this amazing banana slider works great in segmenting a typical GMO banana that follows all of Montsano's specs (including slicing the banana into 18 slices of identical thickness), it only works well for cross grained cuts. I tried ripping bananas lengthwise with this tool. Not only were the results poor, mismatched in size and thickness and generally uneven, but the process itself was fraught with difficulty. I could not get the banana to stand upright by itself, while attempting to rip it lengthwise.

I mean come on, you're telling me this thing can actually stay sharp after three or four bananas?  If you seriously want to slice the right way, go on Ebay and buy yourself a vintage 326 if you can afford it.  The 220, the 322, and of course the mighty 331 are also great ones, surely any one of these would be far superior to this petroleum based joke. Even an old 209 would be great, though it tends to rust, but the built in sharpener will keep the blades as keen as a set of New York straight razors.  Sure a 326 costs more, but there's nothing like it; the nickel plated zinc alloy chassis, the German steel blades, the micro-serrations, I could go on and on.

I don't know how you did it, but you stole my idea for this ""banana slicer"" invention of ""your's""! The Incredible Banana Ninja was my idea! 3 years ago, I was combing my hair with my old faithful plastic comb and some of the teeth started falling out...not wanting to throw it away, I did what any like-minded, frugal person would do: Headed to the kitchen! I first tried it on pork and spaghetti. The pork was delicious and one ""could"" floss with the hair that remained in the comb, but alas, more tines broke out because the pork was just too solid. The spaghetti would have worked had I used my hair pick from the 80's but since I wasn't ready to part with it in the bathroom, I was left to try the comb. Disaster! Not only was the sauce/hair gel combo nasty to the tastebuds, the teeth of the comb were just too short to properly hold the spaghetti until it reaches the mouth. I ruined my best Sunshine Bear Carebear shirt! It was then that I realized I would have to find something softer. Bananas are not only soft but they are LONG like a comb! With shakey hands, I held the banana, trying to decide to peel or not to peel...Oh hell! Live on the wild side! I peeled, and Ohhh it felt good! Laying the banana on my finest corelle ware plate, I gingerly pressed the comb into the flesh that was the banana...slowly at first, then with a mightly thrust I was IN! Sighing with contentment, I looked at my slightly mangled but clearly sliced Nanner (as I like to call it). That's when I saw it! A movement in my airstream trailer window! Someone was out there and saw what I did! Now I know, that on that fateful day, my ""baby"" was stolen!",sneakysnake

The slices are going to waste my family have tried taking the product off me and they have stopped leaving bananas lying around the house but I will always find a victim to feed my addiction.

They did however make it yellow and shaped it like a banana.  Nice try, Hutzler 571 but all it took was one bite and I was pretty sure it wasn't a real banana.

Ownership of the 571 has allowed me access to a myriad of clubs and inner circles. A whole new world if you will. My problems first began to arise several months down the road. I was already deep into this underground world of banana slicing competitions when I noticed my 571 one would start to get very hot after slicing only a few bananas. After being horrible beaten by an owner of the Fox Run Banana slicer I returned home to contemplate the tragic turn my life had taken. I forced myself to return to this site to see if I could figure out what I was doing wrong. Then I found it. THE SECOND PICTURE! TWO Banana slicers. How could I be so naive. If I purchased two then I could alternate the slicing and whenever one would overheat I could quickl;y switch it out for the back up. With this newly discovered sense of self-worth and accomplishment I returned to Banana Slicing competitions and won my first circuit. I will soon be travelling to Thailand to compete in the World Champoinships.,Adam

In the three weeks before we had given up on trying to consume the banana's due to a lack of an efficient slicing means and had resorted to only use the overpopulation of the fruit as a means to pry open the coconuts.

Well my physical and emotional scars tell the story clear as that sparkling summer sky. She took a sharp knife and attempted to slice into a peeled banana, thankfully that slice came off without a problem. As did the next slice, the next slice, the next and the slice after that. Trouble was not encountered until the 5th banana when the unthinkable happened, she looked right at me and said ""this is stupid, lets just go buy daiquiri mix."" A bullet ripped through my heart, devastating me. I was 20! How was I to buy daiquiri mix! My mind raced, my soul shuddered, the blood drained from my head and I grew faint.

I never dreamed banana slices could be so uniform, manageable and appetizing in appearance. Honestly, by comparison, the weed wacker just made the banana look like snot. And the real bonus?!

As per usual, I selected a number 7 cleaver to effect the sectioning. This utensil is not ideal  as it tends to bruise the fruit, but one must carry on. The work went apace. Unbeknownst to me, one of the discarded peels had slipped  to the floor. The phone rang and as I stood to answer it, my house slipper came down upon the peel. My memory is kind in that the details of what happened next are dim. Cleaver in one hand, I lurched forward, unintentionally  chopping  off the upper section of the pinky on the other hand. The sudden presence of pain and blood understandably sent me reeling, and that damnable banana peel wasn't done with me yet.  Yellow slickness turned my foot, twisted my ankle, brought me down.

He saw the need to have a device to slice bread, a chore that was costing housewives countless hours of drudgery. The rest is history. But, how could he top such an achievement? Well, he did. He worked tiredly to bring to the world his Banana slicer, model 571-OFR. This would be his crowning glory, a device that would slice a whole banana at one time! However, during all the excitement over the release of the now famous bread slicer,(not to mention, his ""Texas Toast"" model released a few years later) and due to the fact that the banana had not had the popularity it enjoys today until after WWII. My Grandfather's lab assistant, Carlo B. Victorio stole this device, selling it on the black market. The model 571-OFR banana slicer's life in the free market was short lived however, as it soon fell into the hands of the world wide communist conspiracy. Although rumored to be used by Lenin himself. Lenin discovered that the uniform slices would not get caught in his beard as slices cut by hand. It was rumored to be buried with Lenin, however Stalin took it, thinking he could copy the simple yet ingenious design to manufacture torture devices. It was eventually stolen by Mussolini, who kept it at his estate in Ancona. Stalin himself later tracked down and ordered the death of his once powerful ally. It was eventually reclaimed and handed back to Carlo Victorio by the Illuminati in 1989, coinciding with the fall of the Berlin wall (Coincidence?).

Alas, my elation turned to despair when I actually tried to use this thing. From my perspective, there are two serious design flaws with this device. Firstly, though the ""ladder"" style handle has plenty of tines for gripping, they are too close together for my fingers to get through. I was able to get two of my smaller fingers into the gripping surface, to my dismay I found that they were so thin that there was a serious danger of cutting myself! Apparently safety was not an important consideration in the design concept. Secondly, the Hutzler 571B was very poor in performing the very function it was purportedly designed for, namely slicing bananas! The single cutting surface was much too thick to actually do more than smoosh the banana- very messy! I don't understand what the designers were thinking when they created this ripoff.

But after the glory came the shame.  My adult teeth began to fall out buy the time I started Kindergarten.  By second grade I had a full set of, you guessed it, baby teeth.  I still have all of them today and take scrupulous care to insure their health.  Unfortunately the downside is that I have to pre cut all of my food.  I am a fan of all tropical fruits and the idea of a dedicated ""banana slicer"" was one that I found intrigueing.  I ordered my 571 and a few weeks later it arrived.  I unwrapped it with aniticipation.  The uniform slices did not disappoint and I was able to easily masticate with my junior choppers just as I had hoped.  But I didnt stop with bananas.  With the 571 I was finally and confidently able to enjoy all sorts of sliced tubular foods; plaintains, zucchini, cucumbers, vienna sausages (regular AND bar-b-q), hotdogs and even PICKLES!  Lastly, I began to suspect that my Scotch Terrier, Mr Wiggles, had a case of the worms.  You guessed it, the 571 made quick work of his scat and I was able to diagnose his intestinal malady!

1115,615,615,5.0,14 Jun 2013,"While the time and money savings are glaringly obvious, I want to underscore how much safer this is than conventional banana slicing methods. Before I bought the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I sliced my bananas the same way as everyone else. I started out like most beginners by using firecrackers and cherrybombs, but this created quite a mess and inevitably cost me my right index finger and thumb. Next, I tried the lawnmower method (running a lawnmower sideways on the counter top). This worked well plus it gave my bananas that ""fresh from the field"" taste. Unfortunately, running my gas powered lawn mower in my poorly ventilated kitchen compelled me to believe the fingers on my left hand were bananas, so I sliced them off and ate them. I woke up in daze a few days later. As I laid there covered in blood, banana paste, and grass clippings, I thought to myself, why is slicing bananas so damn hard?! There must be an easier way!! Using my remaining three fingers, I quickly went hunting online for a better solution. I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. While it appeared overly complicated, I was reassured by the outstanding reviews that this product was a must have. After using the lawn mower method to open the package, and carefully reading the 50 page manual, I tested it out for the first time. WOW!!! This was exactly what my life was missing! It's been over two years and I haven't lost any more fingers! I'd give this product two thumbs up if I still had them!!!",Matthew Pearse
1116,616,616,5.0,05 Apr 2013,"This sleek metonymy for the human condition reifies the heartache of postmodern society even as it negates it. The Hutzler 571 enacts Bakhtin's heteroglossia as it displays in raw form the multiple voices at work inside every banana, proportional and interactive yet distinct and, often, mushy. It is also a device of profound deconstruction, delimiting the fragment-banana and challenging its integrative potential by denying its ability to be reassembled as a cohesive whole (its traces are also ineradicable). From a Freudian psychoanalytical perspective, it is an uncanny castration machine. Moreover, it encapsulates Marxist alienation of labor by eliminating the human element and pride of craftsmanship in banana slicing. The Hutzler 571 is, one could say, the sublime object of ideology. Zizek needs one ASAP (express shipping available). It has earned a place in the museum of consciousness.",Voice of Fredonia

1131,631,631,1.0,21 Mar 2016,"This is by far the least convenient way to slice a banana. First of all, this banana slicer assumes how thick I want my banana slices. Sometimes I want them thinner, sometimes I want them thicker. With this slicer, that's not an option. I can't adjust my slice thickness preference which would have been a helpful feature. Secondly, you are unable to slice the banana vertically for long slices. I mean you can, but you have to cut the banana in half, stand it up and push the slicer down in a condom-like motion and even then the slices are the same presumed width as the standard slicing method. Third, I am unable to slice my banana in big chunks to save for later. Like most people my morning banana slice is generally bigger than my lunch and dinner slices and with this slicer I'm forced to count the slices and divide by meals then adjust proportionately for how hungry I think I'll be. It's a nightmare for people (like me) who don't like math and takes quite a bit of time to figure out. The color is far too similar to the real color of a banana. I'll often slice a banana and lose the slicer visually like a t-rex and have to feel around and dig it out of the banana. I lose about 3 slices in this process to mush. Why didn't they make this slicer bright red or pink?? Storage is a bit of a headache too, the lack of banana slicer stand means it gets thrown into my silverware drawer and the lack of easy access means I forget about it most of the time. I can't leave it out because it's an eyesore and I can't store it with my bananas because I'm afraid I'll accidentally eat it. The only positive thing I'd say this slicer has going for it is that it's microwave safe.",Amazon Customer

1135,635,635,4.0,11 Dec 2012,"Yes I said BLOOD! As those of us in the banana slicer community know, The Hutzler 571 is the replacement for the Hutzler 570 model from a few years ago. Ahhh. The 570, it was a work of art crafted by the famed legend Nikoro Suzake. Young Nikoro studied for years under the reclusive banana implement masters in a remote dojo near the base of Mt. Fuji. One fine day his hard work would pay off When the corporate heads at Hutzler saw a sparkle in young Nikoro's eye and they gave him a job. They provided him with everything a new banana implement master might need. A crew of Apprentices, aides, a workshop and even a scientific laboratory where he could finally complete the long awaited task they had hired him for. Inventing the worlds most perfect banana slicer. It took years of research and failed attempts. Of course many of his contraptions ended up with NASA in the shuttle program but these weren't good enough for Nikoro. Then one early morning in October of 1997 Nikoko shrieked Eureka !! (only in Japanese) His 570th attempt would prove to be pure magic! The dastardly execs at Hutzler knew right away that they had a winner on their hands. But after a few years these greedy corporate fat-cats grew tired of paying Nikoro his royalties and they formed a plan that would save them millions and leave Nikoro in disgrace. They had Nikoko's most trusted young apprentice slightly change the design of slicer. Not enough to effect it's flawless performance, just enough to get a new patent and leave poor Nikoro out in the cold. Nikoro was so ashamed and dis-honored that one night before he was to accept his award from the Banana Slicer Regime for United Success Or B.S.R.U.S. Nikoro pulled out a paring knife that had been gifted to him by his old Implement master and he jammed it into he heart. Thanks a lot Hutzler for taking away the the worlds most highly acclaimed banana slicer design engineer! This is why to this day the rare find of a coveted model 570 brings in values comperable to a painting by Claude Monet. They are of course distinguishable by it's hidden signature on the inside of the third rung from the bottom it say's Nikoro. Everyone, Eat Bananas and watch your back!",happy customer

The poor scatterbrain, the old noggin upstairs isn't working that well anymore, I must add, attempts to eat it whole.  I keep pestering her to slice into bite sized pieces so I never have to worry that she chokes on her favorite fruit; but she's terrified of knives after my similarly demented father cut his finger off a year ago trying to cut his apples up into delicious edible morsels.

It arrived today and I eagerly unwrapped it, already dreaming of putting it to use on my banana tree garden. Alas, it was not to be. Although the ergonomic and sleek design may work for certain ripened bananas, it is next to useless when tackling the much more common ""limp"" or ""mushy"" variety. After many failed and squishy attempts, I searched out a firmer specimen and gave it a shot. At first it was working great, but then I found that my banana was far too large for the Hutzler 571 to handle. In short, I would say that the Hutzler 571 is a fine tool if you only need to cut hard and short bananas, otherwise, I suggest looking elsewhere.",Banana Phone
1219,719,719,1.0,24 Mar 2013,"To say my family was excited the day our 571 Banana Slicer arrived would be a gross understatement. We all felt we had taken one more step towards the future and would be joining the millions of giddy banana slicing aficionados across the globe. Our optimism was soon ship wrecked upon the shoals of disappointment. Upon unwrapping the 571 we marveled at its sleek design. My son and I, being the men of the family, quickly broke a fresh banana off a recently purchased bunch and attempted our first foray into banana slicing bliss. We immediately discovered how difficult it would be to achieve our goal. This first attempt failed miserably. After grasping the 571 in both hands we found it is impossible to get the banana to stand on end. Next we tried the ""one hand on the 571"", ""one hand holding the banana vertical"" approach. This worked somewhat, providing us with several nice, curly slices of banana, but the 571 was stopped short by the hand holding up the banana. My wife suggested we cut off the bottom tip of the next test banana in hopes we could release it from our grasp and thus run the 571 all the way to the bottom. I immediately vetoed this idea considering the potential waste of all those future banana bottoms. Of course she left the kitchen angry but that is an issue we will not dwell on here. My son suggested we drill a 1"" hole 1/2 way through the countertop in which to insert the banana. This was a splendid idea I thought and upon a test run we discovered it did support the banana sufficiently enough to allow the 571 full travel to the base of the fruit, however we were still left with that unsliced nub at the bottom. Honestly I am baffled. If anyone out there has come up with a solution to this quagmire please don't hesitate to share it. This has caused much stress and dismay throughout the family and I don't feel we can move forward as a unit until it is resolved.",J. Ball

I still remember the moment it arrived.  My wife and I had pre-ordered a few bushels of bananas to celebrate the purchase of the Hutzler.  We started slicing bananas right away and long into the night.  The juice of the banana slices ran everywhere as we created banana slice collages, banana wall clings and other common banana slice based crafts.  We cleaned our Hutzler according to the manufacturers specifications and placed it in the special drawer next to the sink I had made for it.  I slept well that night, dreaming of future bananic endeavors.  When I awoke the next morning I found my Hutzler out of its drawer and sitting next to the bananas.  I thought nothing of it, sliced my morning bananas and went about my day.  That evening my dreams were fraught with screams of terrible agony.  I woke up in a cold sweat.  The next night I heard whispers throughout the house.  I grabbed a bat and slowly crept into the kitchen where I found my wife standing naked with piles of mangled bananas around her, the walls and ceilings dripping with unholy potassium enriched sweetness, and an ominous feeling of foreboding and ill will emanating directly from the glistening Hutzler.  She was absent mindedly slamming the Hutzler down onto her hand and had cut nearly though the first epidermal layer!  I ran.  My wife says I imagined the whole thing, but I'm not sure it's her I'm talking to anymore.  I've tried to research the Hutzler but have been stymied.  Message boards hint at some terrible accident at the Hutzler product quality testing facility.  Some very scared people (who wish to remain anonymous) have also told me that the Hutzler's true purpose is to siphon the spirit of every banana it slices to raise up Bananzabub, the demon of tormented produce.  I've thrown it away.  It came back.  We moved to a different state.  I found it sitting on the counter of our new home.  I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.  Please help.",James Casagrand

1230,730,730,3.0,21 Dec 2012,"I bought the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer and quickly noticed that banana slices stick to the blades.  Upon closer examination, I could see that the 571's blades lack the blood groove found on such quality slicing apparatus' as the Hutzler 570 Banana Slicer, the U.S. Marine Corps K-Bar Fighting Knife and the M-9 Bayonet.  Absence of the groove causes a vacuum to form when the life juices of the banana come in contact with the surfaces of the blades, which requires the cutter to have to place their foot against the banana and tug mightily to extricate the slicer from the banana's flesh, a most dangerous proposition considering the sheer number of blades the Hutzler company give this model.  I did not have this problem with Hutzler 570.  When I was finished fighting Marxist guerrillas in the jungle, I knew that as soon as I pulled my K-Bar from the chest of my vanquished enemy that I could sit down under a banana tree, take out my Hutzler 570 and enjoy tasty and soothing sliced bananas while increasing my potassium levels sufficiently to recover in time for the next wave of attacks.  With the absence of such a prominent and necessary feature, I simply do not have the same confidence in the Huztler 571 as I did in the earlier model and I fear I shall be struggling with freeing the banana slicer at a most inopportune time during the next contest of will I must engage in.",Manolo

I would go outside and fire up the ol' wood chipper for some good old fashioned banana slicing mayhem- just the way my father taught me growing up in rural Alabama.

My neighbors hated me for this because of all the noise so early in the morning and of all the banana pieces that would splatter all over the side of their house.

And the latest model I purchased kept freezing up! Admittedly, the banana slicer market is pretty saturated right now, but that's no excuse for dishonest marketing practices. I feel so foolish now, having fallen for so many of those other companies' specious claims, one after the other. What a bunch of shysters! But it's time: I'm coming home to Old Faithful, the 571B.

After receiving it I fell in love, well, after learning to not use 571 on unpeeled bananas (invent a slicer that also peels it, and I will be first in line.)  I began using it daily, and sometimes more than once.  I found myself purchasing bananas on the streets in NYC, so i decided I may need to start carrying it around.  On the first day of said plan, I tucked it firmly in my skinny jeans and made my way to the subway.  I was late, so I didn't have a chance to use it on the way to the subway but knew I would be using it as soon as i stepped off.  I carry a messenger bag, but sometimes I buy a banana so quickly I have no time to rifle through it in order to get the slicer.  The subway was crowded, but I was lucky and slid into the last seat in the car.  As soon as I sat I heard a slicing noise, and felt a shooting pain in my lap area.  The following blood let me know what I had just done.  I grabbed my crotch and ran to the nearest hospital.  I had the best surgeons (I was told john bobbitt had the same ones) but even they said ""We have never seen anything like this, since we dealt with that egg slicer incident.)

With the recent upswing in the economy, the market was `ripe' for a vending cart that specialized in naner slices on toothpicks and I swooped in to corner the business.  We had the usual growing pains, but when business started to sky-rocket, I was left without a way to cut uniform naner slices on the fly; enter the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer.  At first we had issues with this product; too often the naners were curved in the opposite direction of the slicer.  This frequently left us with non-uniform naner slices and even worse, uncut naner ends where the naner curved outside of the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer's frame (`naner waste' is the bane of our industry).  In frustration I wrote to Victorio Kitchen Products and remarkably, Victor V Victorio himself flew out to address our issue.  He studied our dilemma for 3 days and flew in 3 additional Nanologists.  Well, finally, after six months and 7 prototypes, they designed and fabricated a machine that makes every naner curve the same way as the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer.

1276,776,776,5.0,20 Dec 2012,"What else can I say that hasn't already been said about this breakthrough in modern-day technology?  Well, a lot actually.  The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer makes good on its promise to be more reliable and durable than the 569 and 568 models.  Each 571 Slicer is hand-crafted and molded from the limited edition Laserdiscs of various Patrick Swayze classics with a yellow sheer gloss finish provided by lead paints found in houses built in the 18th Century.  It is a giant leap in progress from the 569 model, which you may remember caused the Divorce Rate to finally exceed 50% of marriages in 1994.  One thing to keep in mind about this new model is its stem replica handles at the top and bottom of the Slicer, first seen in model 568, making a much-needed return. The stem replicas are incredibly intuitive when dangling the Slicer over a group of starving South American children.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has ever dreamed about making their life just a little bit more enjoyable.  But please do keep in mind that this item is BANNED in Canada for its dislike of the game of hockey and its current pending patent lawsuit with the Gauser 356 PickleDicker.  However, if you are in the United States and desire something that can keep the whole family busy in weekly therapy, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is definitely for you.

I always fear buying products from the internet as they could be linked so some supernatural presence, especially when they are sharp.  It all started when I received my package at the door.  Upon opening the package I started to hear faint voices overhead warning me not to open the container. Well, I was on several pain medications due to the botched electrotherapy that I received from the Peruvian mental hospital while on vacation so I decided to not listen to the voices.  I take my plastic knife, as that's all I'm legally allowed to own (under 3 inches) and attempted to cut the tape.  I ended up breaking three knives before getting the box open.  Once the box was open i slid my hand along the lid as i pryed it open and reach my hand in and cut my finger on the instructions.  I knew that was a sign to stay out.  I quickly shut the lid and prayed.  After several days of praying and showering in holy water I hired an exorcist to open the package and retrieve my Hutzler 571.

1279,779,779,5.0,02 Jan 2013,"So I was eating a banana and thought to myself ""I wish this was cut into even slices"". And ever since that thought crossed my mind, I set forth on an adventure to find a solution to my banana crisis. I spent years examining different bananas, and studying their complex structure, and after I gathered a surplus of data I came to the conclusion that bananas are in fact able to be cut. I tried cutting them with a knife, however the slices were never even! This is when I knew I had to take my research to the next step. I went to Florida, the place were bananas are grown in the U.S. I asked them if they knew how to cut bananas into perfectly even slices, and they all stared at each other and were hesitant to speak. I asked once again, but they gave me no response. I was ready to give up, when a man in tattered clothes walked up to me and said, ""If I were you, I would stop right now. Many have tried to find the way to cut a banana into perfectly even slices, but all have failed."" I looked into his eyes and said, ""My lifes meaning, is to cut bananas into even slices. I HAVE to do this! How do you know nobody has ever succeeded?"" He gave me the most intense stare I have ever seen, and as I saw the years of pain in his eyes he responded, ""Because I once shared the same dream as you. If you truly wish to learn the sacred methods of even banana slicing, you must travel to Papua New Guinea. This is where the bananas originated from. Once you get there ask for MusaMusa, and if you can prove yourself worthy to learn the ancient banana cutting secrets, he will teach you himself."" At this moment I knew my adventure was about to get serious. Days later after a long boat ride, I arrived to the sacred place where banana's originate from. I asked the first person I saw to take me to MusaMusa, and the man told me ""I will show you the way."" We hiked deep into a tropical jungle and stopped when we got to a small little hut. I turned around to thank the man for taking me, but he was gone. I nervously walked into the hut, and saw a man sitting by himself in the middle of the hut intensely staring at a banana.  He told me, ""Sit, and tell me what brings you here"" I shared with him my adventure, and told him that I wish to learn the ancient banana cutting secrets. He put a knife in my hand and said ""Take this, and kill me. It's the only way the spirits will reveal to you the secret."" I was doubtful, but I saw the look on his face, and I knew he was serious. I said nothing more and stabbed him, and as I watched him he said to me ""I was just joking... Use...the...computer..."" I turned around to where he was pointing and noticed a laptop. I checked what was on it and I saw it open to this very page. Without hesitation I ordered this right away and took the first flight home. As soon as I got to my house I saw the package in my doorstep and as I opened it, I knew all my research  was worth it.

It was later found out that it was actually the Hutzler 570 in disguise the whole time. Its reputation ruined when the 571 came out it hid its identity and posed as the 571 to get back at the people who had once used him and then threw him away when the newer model came out. He killed several people and quickly hopped a plane to South America. I followed his trail and learned that it had tried to hide away in the country of Colombia....in Putumayo's capital city of Mocoa. It used the money it stole to purchase prostitutes and began a nasty cocaine habit. I secretly watched the local brothels and asked around to its whereabouts when I finally stumbled upon him one day.

Apparently tipped off by one of the locals that I that I had spoken with about him he had departed before my arrival, but left a trail of banana pieces behind him. I followed the banana pieces into the mountains of Colombia. There I finally confronted him at the edge of a cliff overlooking a waterfall that spilled into a rapid moving stream 100 feet below. It turned around a looked me straight in the eye. I said, ""How could you do this? We brought you into our home! ...and this is how you repay us?!? You ruined our family! You ruined our community!!!"" ""It was easy"" he said. ""You people with your strawberry and banana smoothies, and your banana creme pies......you never saw it coming."" ""Well you're going to see this coming!"" I said and pulled out my 9mm handgun. Before I could get a shot off it smirked at me and jumped off the cliff, plunging into the rapidly moving stream below.

However, after years of this routine I decided I needed to check my purpose in life and start focusing on my family. Needless to say, my husband continued on with the obsession. He started staying out all night slicing bananas. He had gotten so bad that he even missed work to use the 571. I knew he was in the late stages of his banana slicing obsession when he began slicing bananas first thing in the morning. I finally confronted him when he wouldn't even sleep at night and his skin began to turn yellow from using the 571. He promised he would leave the slicer in the cupboard, but that was just the beginning of one broken promise after another. Eventually I called a professional banana slicing interventionist who got my husband to agree to abstain from banana slicing and start to go to BSA meetings. I soon began to hate banana slicing anonymous meetings, they took my husband away from me. I began to think that he really wasn't going to meetings, but rather sneaking off to slice them yellow bastards.I started following him to his meetings to make sure he was doing what he said. Only did I find out that he was going and all the other guys that also went would walk out the doors after the meeting with big smiles, they seemed happy. I was enraged. I grabbed that slicer from the cupboard only to find out it was gone. I searched the house up and down only to find several dozen banana slicers stashed in hiding spots. I finally called for help and the woman on the phone advised that I go to a support group for wives of husbands who slice bananas to a near death. All the woman complained about how their husbands did the exact same thing as mine. MosT of them were telling me to end my marriage as nothing will change if his slicing progressed to chronic yellow skin and hiding slicers stage. As for myself, I filed for divorce and joyfully returned to my hutzler 571 to enjoy the liesure activity of banana slicing, this was my own way to seek revenge. For my ex-husband who has ended up in jail from attempting to drive while slicing bananas in his lap, I will visit him once in a great while and joyfully slice bananas through the thick glass pane.

I now have time to do both and get to working time to complete my TPS reports. This produce is ideal for the busy mom trying to feed her kids a healthy lunch full of potassium. With the Hutzler 571b banana slicer you can slice the 20-30 bananas that your child needs for a quality lunch. Enjoy this produce as I have. Finally I recommend the cereal dispenser to complete your kitchen, for those days when you just don't have time to tip a cereal box on its side.",571beloved

You know, the stark, yellow-on-white photo of the device I think we're all familiar with.  I didn't notice her there until she started to sniffle a little, and then start crying softly.  I looked at her and saw that innocent, questioning gaze bordering on fear as her lower lip quivered.  ""Daddy, is that what happens to bananas when they die?""  She didn't let me answer as she bolted from the room crying ""Bananie!  You're gonna die!""  Yeah, that's right - her favorite stuffed animal is a friggin' banana!

1297,797,797,1.0,30 Jan 2013,"I am very disappointed in my Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. Obviously, since it is yellow, it is meant to be used on pineapples. Unfortunately, this was not made clear in the owner's manual. The product label should clearly state ""Hutzler 571 Banana--NOT PINEAPPLE--Slicer."" I filed a class-action lawsuit with my attorney, but he argued that pineapples are golden-brown. Imbecile. Who wants to slice a pineapple on the outside?! Anyway, I have discovered that the included 802.11n Wi-Fi capabilities and external ethernet port have allowed me to use it as a wireless adapter for my X-box 360 Elite with a slight modification in firmware. However, I have discovered that others have ""bricked"" their slicer while attempting to do likewise. Also, those n00bs in COD keep blowing me up with nanner-nades.

1333,833,833,5.0,24 Apr 2013,"There is a small tribe in the heart of the Klungowomi Jungle in Africa. This place is a modern day lost world. The jungle has multiple pygmy tribes living throughout it who are constantly at war. They carry miniature spears to fight with and there has been unrest between the tribes for as long as their histories have recorded. The central cause of the brutal violence stems from a banana dispute. Bananas are the only type of food in the region. Pygmies only need a small amount of food but because they cannot cut the bananas, the tribes must fight for the resources. I am an anthropologist. For my PH.D dissertation, I traveled to the Klungowomi to live with and study the pygmies. My wife bought me the Hutzler 571 when she heard I was traveling to this banana-rich region so that I could slice my bananas. When I first arrived, the pygmies were terrified of me because of my size. However, when I pulled out my Hutzler, an incredible awe fell over the tribe. The mini-chief of the tribe said something in his native tongue which roughly translates to ""Our savior has arrived!"" All the pygmies bowed down to me after that (think of C-3PO and the Ewoks in Star Wars Episode VI). I accepted their worship and then blessed them with the banana slicer. As soon as the chief received the banana slicer, he gave it to his fiercest little warrior who ran off into the jungle. Hours later, the warrior pygmy came back with another pygmy who appeared to be the chief of a rival tribe. After much talk, the two chiefs grabbed each others hair and pulled a large chunk out. Later, I found out that this is the symbol for a pygmy peace treaty. As word of the banana slicer traveled through pygmy land, more and more hair was pulled. By the end of the ordeal, most of the chiefs had no hair remaining. There was now a way for each pygmy to get exactly his fill of banana; no more, no less. Statues of me were erected in each pygmy town and to this day, I am still the pygmy savior. I am so glad my wife purchased me the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!!",Antro_Savior

Everyone gets their fair share now. And now my children look at my wife the way they used to look at me, it makes me feel warm inside.",bwilf1
1341,841,841,5.0,06 Feb 2013,"Well, I know it may seem silly, but believe me when I say that this banana slicer is a life saver!! It all started when I was out in my orchard, picking bananas, when suddenly, there was a bright light directly overhead! I tried to run, but was suddenly caught in some sort of blue beam. Before I knew it, I was being pulled up to what appeared to be an alien space craft!! Next thing I know, I am laying on a table, motionless, with several small grey beings surrounding me. It was like something out of a movie! I thought for sure I was about to be probed or whatever those creepy things do to us earthlings. Fortunately, they hadn't strapped my hands down yet. It was then that I remembered that I had my trusty Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in my back pocket. I quickly pulled it out and presented it to my captors, as some sort of peace offering. But rather than them taking it, they marveled its very shape and construction and started to back away from me. I hopped off the table, holding the Slicer in front of me as one would do with a crucifix to a vampire. The aliens kept recoiling in fear of this awe-inspiring yellow thing, not knowing what to make of it. Clearly, they must have realized that this marvel of modern technology must of been a dangerous weapon of sorts. There could be no explanation because the next thing I know, I was zapped back into my orchard, ready to continue picking bananas. Thank you Hutzler, for inventing humanity's greatest hope against the invading alien hordes!! Now where did I put my strawberry de-corer?",Doron Markowitz

I have had him treated for frostbite twice this month.  I have contacted Hutzler and asked them to install a flange extending from the edges, making it wider than a canine mouth.

1343,843,843,1.0,28 Jan 2013,"While everyone seems to be so in love with their banana slicers, I have some problems with it. The cuts are about 1mm too thick for my taste. This may sound like a petty difference to most, but I've sliced my bananas at exactly 7mm my entire life and I'm now 48 and not about to change my preferences. Therefore, prior to usage, I had to bend each 'blade' slightly which was such a vexing task (bend the first one 1mm, second one 2mm, third one 3mm -- imagine keeping track of this until the last one - it was Microsoft Excel chartkeeping hell for a whole day). The result is not only aesthetically lacking, but the cuts aren't perfectly straight. I can deal with this on days when everything else goes well and I'm in my forgiving ""zen"" zone, but when I have visitors, I can't possibly serve them banana slices like this! You see, I'm known for my rigid persnicketiness. Hiring a professional welder for the job might help, but that would add an unreasonable sum to the overall cost of the banana slicer. Maybe it's worth it. I have a son-in-law who's a welder and might cut me a deal. It would, however, blow my cover in front of my entire extended family for not managing to cut those perfect slices on my own accord. Buying the welder's silence is yet another expense, and unrealiable. The guy yaps like a tween girl.",Mooky

First off, let me say that the 20 gauge plastic used in this product is bar none the best plastic on the market.  The beauty of this product is the thin long design that fits easily into my pocket and sometimes even my cargo shorts.  I do get snide comments occasionally about the old ""Is that a banana in your pocket"" joke, but the jokes on them, cause they don't have a 571B banana slicer and we will see who is laughing when it comes time to slice bananas at breakfast.  Very portable, however one of my greatest fears is loosing my Hutzler, so I often check my pockets to ensure its safety.  It feels strong and sturdy in my hand, the 571B also feels the same.",KBT

Tears ran down my face as I hastily typed by credit card number in and confirmed my order.  The day it arrived in the mail made the days my children were born seem inconsequential.

1353,853,853,5.0,19 Jan 2013,"Ever since discovering the appendage dangling between my legs as a hirsute toddler, I have felt an obsessive need to take action.  Nothing I could define, and yet my only peace in life for many years, other than flinging my own feces at the progression of inquisitive faces on the other side of the bars, came from obsessive slicing of bananas with a paring knife.  Until one day, an inquisitor tried to stab me through the bars with a Lady Bic pen.  I wrestled it away, and it instantly began a process of ""automatic writing,"" the results of which, upon examination, proved to be the instructions for sex reassignment surgery.  Step one, written in an enviably ornate script, was the purchase of the Hutzler sex-change slice-and-tuck 69D, fortunately available on Amazon after long having been sold only to the armed forces and medical personnel.  There was just one snag--the Lady Bic Pen, which had put me in a rapturous pink mist of helpless feminine incompetence, suddenly made my happiest occupation impossible.  While soon I'd be without the banana dangling between my legs, my weak, delicate digits could no longer manage the difficult task of slicing with a paring knife.  I knew, beyond doubt, only two things.  That I must become a Lady Bic female, and that I could never give up my passion for slicing bananas.  Only days ago, I had climbed up and out of the Empire State Building observation deck, already having dropped any hope of solving my life's impossible contradictions.  As I prepared to swing away into neutered eternity, an enormous hairy paw appeared and in its odiferous folds was a Hutzler 571B banana slicer.

A man on the moon!!! This is truly insane. I was driven away by the insanity of my daily job. It was so torturous; I tried contacting the government, my local police department, the better business bureau, and anyone else I could think of. At the time, I was working at a little known mom and pop store known as Walman & Martin's. My daily torture was to slice nearly ONE HUNDRED banana's for the daily banana bread and banana nut muffins. Eventually driven insane by this task I left for Japan to train in the way of the sword. I told only one person of my plan. As I slowly honed my skills I learned to slice bananas at blistering speeds. Finally, ready to face the bananas once again I headed home to find so much had changed. A man on the moon! I mean c'mon really. As I arrived back home I returned to my home town and was on my way to Walman & Martin's only to find some gigantic, hideously huge, blue attrocity in its place with the name wal-mart on it(I later found out that Walman and Martin both disappeared under strange circumstances and were never heard from again). Going into the store I was greeted by an old man and eschewed into the bakery department where I was blown back by a familiar smell. Another very old man in a blue apron shakily handed me a piece of banana bread and in one taste I knew it was the Walman family recipe. What was going on here? Confused I stumbled into the cuttlery department where there it was . . . the 571B as I watched the again, oddly old women demonstrating the banana slicing fluidity of the 571B I realized that I had wasted my entire life in mastering the way of the sword. I looked for work in many of the professions requiring high speed precision cutting. . . but in the end they all ended the same . . .some dumb ass got in my way while I was cutting and got themselves seriously injured . . . like that's my fault. I was almost over the destruction of the 571B and then a few months back I ran into an old friend (oddly enough his 70 year old father happened to be the greeter at wal-mart). I learned that he was now living in California in some big mansion. Apparently he had made all of his money over some app thing called fruit ninja, whatever that is.

1361,861,861,5.0,22 Jan 2013,"Born into a half Philippino, half Norwegian commune on the border Lackawanna and Buffalo in 1923, Karl Hutzler displayed an incredible propensity for the quartering of seed based fruits from an early age.  Realizing at the ripe age of 14 that he would need to work with the masters of the fruit slicing community if he ever wanted to be taken seriously, he decided he would have to move to the Prussian Capitol of Konigsberg.  So in 1937 he sold his prized freeze dried plantain collection to purchase a one way ticket to glory.  Arriving in Konigsberg with nary a Deutsch mark to his name, he relied on the kindness of strangers to keep him in good stead.  This was an unfortunate decision as he was beaten within a heartbeat of his life.  He was forced to ""recover"" on the streets of Konigsberg.  He survived on a diet of scraps and horse dung.  Little did he know this experience was to transform him into the bastion of fruit slicing that we know today.  As his taste for dung grew, he experimented with different flavors and studied the feeding habits of the local horses.  He found that if he cut the dung into ""slices"" it tasted better when eaten with hay and dirt.  Using his natural skill as a fruit quarterer, he grabbed a pitchfork and used the vertical tines to ""slice"" the dung.  He realized what he needed to do!  Karl saved up all the money he made from his special ""Pferdemistkuchen"" or ""horse dung cake"" business and in little more than 31 years he was able to afford the ticket home.  Upon returning to America he moved into his mother's basement where he would smoke weed and play Grateful Dead albums for 11 more years, but, in 1979 a case of the munchies would bring him back to his purpose for living.  After a particularly copious weed smoking marathon in the garage, Karl watched his dog squatting in the backyard.  This brought him back to Konigsberg, and his whole life flashed in front of his eyes.  Knowing America's distaste for dung related products, but also its love of oblong food products, Karl raided his mom's cupboards for ideas.  Opening the freezer he saw it, a frozen putrefied black banana, he knew, he knew.  Taking what was left of his inheritance (about $43) he went to The Home Depot and bought all the tools he would need for his gift to mankind. After 570 failed attempts, he was finally satisfied, plus with $25 dollars he could still get an eighth of Jamaican Red Eye (this was 1979, so it was cheaper).  He had spent his fortune, not to mention his life, making the most revolutionary eating assistance product ever.  Then tragically in 1983 he would perish in the great nitrous oxide explosion outside Meadowlands Stadium during the Dead's ""Little Red Rooster"" Tour.  He would never know the accolades his name was soon to evoke, but one thing is for sure, he will never be forgotten.",Toche44

1373,873,873,5.0,01 Jan 2013,"Wow. To be quite honest, this creative and fun product saved my marriage, and my life. Before the 571 Banana Slicer came into my life, I was in a bad place. Openly sobbing in the California Pizza Kitchen. Throwing rocks at familiar dogs. Masturbating in the children's library - my life was spinning out of control about as quickly and efficiently as this innovative tool slices bananas. Before this product, the sheer thought of making a fruit salad was enough to launch me into a drinking binge the likes of which would have made Amy Winehouse reconsider the notion of rehab. The frustration that used to be involved in dicing bananas still haunts the back of mind like ghosts; filled with emptiness, sometimes imperceptible, but always present. My wife sent my two children to live with her parents and almost left me herself, that's how bad this got. They took me to programs, staged interventions, we even tried both doctor-prescribed medication as well as some all-natural holistic treatments kindly suggested by my wife's acupuncturist, Wizard. Sadly, nothing we tried worked. I felt demeaned, valueless, dirty and sinful. I was on the edge and about it end it all, when I received an anonymous package in the mail. To this day I don't know who or what sent me the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, but I have a feeling that it was my guardian angel. It's been two months since I started using this (quite literally) life-saving tool and I'm almost 100% rehabilitated. My marriage has dramatically improved. My kids are moving back in any day now. I feel like a whole person, perhaps for the first time in my entire life. I've since then found God, not just in the slicing of bananas but in all sorts of tropical fruits: watermelons, papayas, jack fruit, etc. If you're looking for efficacy, happiness, or even salvation, look no further because you have found it in this wonderful addition to your kitchen's silverware-drawer. Thank you, for everything. In the wise words of Mahatma Gandhi: ""Is it not enough to know the evil to shun it?

I can't believe people are actually shelling out $3.38 of their hard-earned money for something like this when it's so easy to make a better one yourself. Just take some leftover armature wire from your last project--9-gauge works best, but anything between 11-1/2- and 6-gauge will do. Bend it into a banana shape (you may want to use a banana from the pantry for a template) and with a triangular file make notches at 3/16-inch intervals, or 1/4-inch if you like your slices thicker. Take some stainless-steel or bronze wire, about 22-gauge (old banjo strings work great) and loop it around the notches, starting at one end and advancing every couple of loops. Keep it good and tight. Tie a knot at the end with needle-nose pliers, trim off the excess, and cover up any sharp ends with a drop of solder. Voila! You have a banana slicer every bit as good as this one for less than a dollar. Back home we'd make them in several thicknesses--3/16-inch for normal use, 1/4-inch for camping trips, 5/32-inch for formal occasions. My little brother got a whupping for making one that made 7/16-inch thick slices.

My oatmeal was ruined and I had to make another bowl. I grabbed another banana and tried again. Useless! When you hold the banana slicer in your hand, it feels ergonomic, but when you go to slice the banana, the blade does not cut. It simply presses and squishes the banana around. The tip just mangles the banana all up. So now imagine me sitting on the floor in my room, surrounded by mutilated bananas and trashed bowls of oatmeal. I did manage to find the best way to slice the banana after my 3rd trip to the grocery store for my 6th bunch of bananas. When you hold the banana slicer in your hand (it should be like you are holding a gun), press the tip into the middle of the banana. Then rock it back and forth until a chunk of banana comes off. Of course I had been using this technique all along but I did not imagine it would take me so long to get a hang of it. It's really all about how much of a rocking motion you can put into the banana. Because they've got the slicer designed like a banana, and it fits into your hand, again like a gun, your wrist really has to make an effort to rock forwards and backwards.

My children even have started to look at me as less of a man, especially after our neighbors bought one of these, and started slicing away with ease.  I was too proud to play ""keep up with the Jones'"" but finally I caved.  And let me tell you, since then I've never looked back. Now I'm the one looking down at the neighbors as I separate my slices.  My children adore, me and President Obama even called me to set up a ""Banana summit""  Happy times are here again.

After many failed attempts with things like chainsaws, weed wackers and an upside down lawnmower I found what I thought was my best solution, a bear. Sounds dangerous you say? It is. I've been keeping it chained in the corner of the kitchen. When I need them sliced I begin poking him with a stick to infuriate him. Once good and agitated I could finally begin to toss them at his face. One swipe would obliterate the bananas. Obviously this caused some problems in the house. The bear has killed both of my wives, 3 out of my 4 children, 2 cats and 6 dogs. If this thing works I will turn the bear loose in my neighbor's basement because he used to always hit on my wife before she was eaten and I can rid myself of 2 problems in 1 day.

But soon I started competing against friends online to see who was the best. I found myself obsessing over this game. Soon I became an online champion, but something was still missing. Yes, I had battled and beat every foe I faced, but I still yearned for more. That's when my obsession had become a reality. I found myself in the wrapped up in the secret underground world of competitive fruit slicing exhibitions with other ninjas such as myself. It's hard to describe the adrenaline rush you feel when it's just you, your katana blade, and another ninja in a heads up, winner take all fruit toss/slicing match. That was until I faced the reigning underground champion ""the black dragon."" It was an intense battle. There were oranges, strawberries, watermelons, and apples halves everywhere. It all came down to the final winner take all speed round of banana slicing. The banana was thrown, we both went for the winning slice, and that's when it happend. The dragon had made a vertical slice as I was making a horizontal one, and in doing so, he chopped off most of my right hand and fingers, leaving me with mostly just nubs on my right hand. And in one slice, he ended my dream of becoming a true fruit ninja. I left the competition a broken man. I wondered for years, aimlessly wondering if I would ever find purpose or meaning in my life again. Anytime I would see fruit, or the thought of having to eat it whole, I would cringe.

Also, the Banana Slicer *itself* is shaped like a banana, which can be confusing at times. I work with many bananas at once, and if I encounter a banana with inadequate curvature to meet the design, it must be rejected. The disadvantage to the Banana Slicer's shape is that slices toward the end of the unit are cut more diagonally, which isn't as aesthetically pleasing.

It was the best weapon for the job when the hordes of banana descended on our home, ruthlessly attacking all that I held dear. I knew immediately that I would have to respond with swift decisive action. Luckily I sleep with my Hutzler 571 next too me in bed. As opposed to earlier Hutzler 570 warfare, this battle included much cleaner kills. I proudly stood with my children at the end of the battle, each brandishing their own personalized Hutzler 571. We will now rebuild our decimated community with the copious amount of perfectly even banana slices that resulted from the conflict.

However, natural variation in a banana's curve angle of the dangle (direction of the curve) are sometimes out of whack with the 571's slice-ability. This means it works great on bananas that curve in the direction of the mold, but some bananas simply curve the other direction and do not the fit the 571. Another downside is that it was engineered for right handed people, and takes extra determination for a lefty to use.",Matt Miller

When I received the Hutzler 571, I assumed it was similar to many of the other adult novelties in my vast collection.

Well, the bad news is that my doctor told me that recovery for a perforated urethra is approximately 4-6 weeks. But the silver lining is that I will be featured in the May issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. I'm pretty sure it would do a great job at slicing bananas though.",Matthew D Kornhaas

I have heard that Hutzler just unveiled the upgrades that will be available on the 572 that will be released in the fall. I will be one of the people camping out at the Hutzler Store hoping to get the new model. They say that the 572 will be thinner and make paper thin banana slices. You will be able to adjust the slice size. There is also a color code to tell if the banana is ripe or not. Green not ripe. Brown beyond ripe. The future of banana slicing is now people! What a great time to be alive!  I will keep my other Hutzlers though. I wouldn't dare throw away or trade in the older models. We have had so many magical slicing memories and laughs.

For one thing, there is no way to adjust it to fit different sizes and shapes of bananas so you have to bring it to the grocery store with you every time you go shopping, to make sure that you don't buy bananas that won't fit it. But even more disappointing is the fact it doesn't come with some kind of device for removing those little stickers from the peels. How stupid is that? It reminds me of the other food-related appliance I ordered last summer that you put inside a bag of ballpark unshelled peanuts and it shells them and shoots them (more or less) into your mouth.

For some reason, I simply cannot get it to slice straight!  I just get two really long, crooked, banana slices, and they are not round as advertised.  I've tried almost everything, but it just is too difficult to hold the banana straight while slicing.  First, I peel the banana (DUH!) then hold it vertically.  But it keeps either breaking the banana when I bring the slicer down, or the slices are just not very straight - not to mention I only get two slices instead of the advertised amount.  I've tried just about everything.  I've held the banana between my knees, but it makes a mess (and it gets all over my hands).  I tried clamping the banana vertically in my shop vice, but that makes a mess too.  Maybe they should look into making some sort of banana holder to go with this product.",Amazon Customer

Oh, the humanity!  Needless to say, I could never partake in the light of public life, lest an acquaintance possibly observe this most boorish behavior and alert colleagues and those most dear alike, leaving me to spend my remaining days in the lonely contemplation of ill repute.",Techno Tom

I was at one of those white elephant parties, you know, where everyone exchanges some sort of gag gift then gleefully fight over ownership of the best one. I picked the package with the 571. Sure everyone had a good laugh. I didn't see the humor. Lucky for me that no one challenged the gift, and I could take my prize home. There was something about the Hutzler that got its hooks into me right away and I couldn't stop thinking about her. The graceful curve of the back, the soft sensual yellow finish, and that oh so perfect mid-section. My fingers would explore those eighteen delightful segments for hours and hours. I would wake up sometimes in the middle of the night to a sweaty panic, but she would be there under my pillow to calm my fears and assure me that everything would be ok. Yes, my wife thought this was unusual behavior even for me, but she passed it off as a mid-life crisis of sorts, certain it would blow over soon. It didn't. I started making excuses to be alone with my beautiful Hutzler every chance I could. Then the trouble started.","Virtual Habitat, Inc."

1594,1094,1094,5.0,15 Jan 2013,"Giving this item a 1 star out of 5 for trivial reasons (e.g., because you are unable to slice apples with it) is irresponsibly punishing a very useful device for your incompetence in reading a description (my sincere apologies for the bluntness). Although this device makes vague claims about fruit and cereal in its description, I think that having ""banana"" in its name absolves the company of liability or blame for inability to slice other fruits or otherwise exceed the intended purpose. Other complaints regarding the need for a model that slices bananas of a ""left handed"" variety are clearly warranted, however...  I would highly recommend that you consult an attorney before posting a scathing review of a product that does its job well judged by its product description. There also might be legal ramifications for misusing this product (I'm SURE that the company's liability is limited to BANANA cutting injuries) or, at least, misrepresentation of the harm that it has done to you. Although I wish you the best with this product, I hope that you will reconsider the impact that it has on your life before issuing such a low rating without proper justification. Companies must take some risk while innovating to solve the major problems in our lives... By chastising those companies for their innovation, we risk missing out on the cure for cancer, the solution to world hunger, and the precise, uniform slicing of ALL fruits.

So I started calling my neighbors desperately asking for help. When Marlena showed up with the Hutzler 571, my jaw dropped and I said 'what the hell is that?'. I'd never seen anything like it. She instructed me to stay calm and just concentrate on peeling. I was stunned as she started blazing through bananas at a speed I had never imagined possible.

Arnesto now eats bananas like crazy, and this contraption makes it easy enough for him to slice the bananas for himself. Whenever he wants a banana he just says ""Nestor, vouchsafeth me the 571b banana slicer!"" I then joyfully vouchsafeth it to him. I'm telling you people, this thing works wonders.

I try to reason with them, saying that knives are sharp, dangerous tools that should only be used by those licensed to do so.

This leads to wasted bananas, since their unskilled hands often do not cut the bananas into evenly spaced slices, forcing us to throw away the mangled pieces.

We have a TON of fingers between the 11 of us (12 if you include the wife, but she's more of a reserve) but we only have ONE dishwasher.

I'd be stupid to buy a competitor's inferior product! I'm right-handed, so I knew this was the model for me, but when it arrived in the mail, I was shocked at the shoddy workmanship! I could barely read the personally engraved message on the side (""No man is a man, who is not a banana-cutting man""). In addition, the accompanying leather carrying pouch was shipped separately! I was shocked and disgraced! When I came to work carrying my 571B in my hands, everyone laughed at me, brandishing their custom-made leather or snakeskin pouches.

For years i struggled with getting the segments of the bananas exactly the same size...at first it was hours with a knife and measure..i would sometimes get through several bananas until i got the perfect slice...but deep down i knew that as hard as i tried i would never find perfection...my friends would not see me for days..my boss was losing patients...my girlfriend left me..days turned into weeks...weeks into months..Then i see it..the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer i couldn't believe it...was it too good to be true??

I usually have a very difficult time with tasks like that. Most people don't recognize me though, because they usually put a big red 'X' over whatever scenes I have. Well, not that long ago, I was attempting to slice a banana for my cereal, when tragedy struck. Unfortunately, 3 of my fingers made it into my corn flakes, while none of the banana did. The kind nurse at Hamilton Memorial told me to 1. Stay away from anything sharp, and 2. Invest in a Hutzler 571. I have not looked back since.",gdm27

NOT FUN! Thanks to the Hutzler 571 I have saved on my electric bill (running the dryer 8 hours a day is costly) and economized on my time as well! Great product!

1747,1247,1247,1.0,12 Dec 2012,I was about order the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer but had second thoughts.  Slicing bananas manually with only the muscle strength of one's hands to complete the cut is no easy task.  Through industry connections I understand that the next model to be released will be electric  powered with the slicing elements heated red hot.  All one needs to do is to place the slicer on the banana and the heated device will fall right thru the banana without any effort.  So I am definitely awaiting for when the newer version becomes available and recommend the same to others.,Peter Feldmann

1751,1251,1251,5.0,01 Jan 2013,"So, back in the day when you had to slice bananas the hard way. With a knife, samurai sword, strait edge razor, or any other cutting mechanism. It just took up too much time and effort trying to get the perfect banana slice width every time. So I've dedicate my life to the research and development of banana slicers, peelers, and other apparatuses to make that little yellow devil much more tangible. So what's the problem with knives you ask. Well the problem with knives is that you hardly ever get the perfect cut, and by the time you get to the end of the banana all the pieces either get stuck to eachother or the knife you are using to cut them. I've even went to the lengths of making an automatic banana slicer, how you ask. Well I modified the blade of an old trolling motor I had spare, and constructed a holding tank for the banana pieces that consisted of a 5 gallon bucket with tiny holes at the bottom and inside the bucket was banana oil and as the banana oil drained out of the holes it would recirculate back into the top of the bucket and repeat the process over and over. That way when the banana slices fell into the bucket they would be coated with banana oil so they would not stick together. The tank was only able to hold about 17-28 pounds of bananas at at time before the weight of the bananas slices at the top of the tank would crush the ones at the bottom and clog the holes. The only solution for this problem I had at the time was to just use less bananas. But this was not an option, and one day when I was slicing bananas I got too cocky. And thought it would be a good idea to slice two bananas at once, boy was I wrong. When I was feeding the bananas through the slicer my finger accidentally got into the path of the blade, and since I sharpened the surgical steel blades as much as I possibly could they didn't have much trouble slicing my pointer finger right off. So I went to the hospital and they said could fix my finger, which they did. But when I got back I despised my old piece of crap banana slicer and sought to find one more finger friendly, and that's just what I did. My friend Horatio showed me this amazing product called the Hutzler 571 banana slicer. It was simple yet so intricate that it  could cut the perfect banana slices every time and the don't stick to the slicer because it is made of a silicon-polyethylene mixture that dishwasher safe and practically indestructible. This product is a must have if you are one who is genuinely serious about slicing your bananas In a way that is safe for you and your children. And I can only hope for the day when the geniuses from Hutzler can make an automatic model of this product, then will I know that I can rest assured that all bananas will be sliced EQUALLY!",Lonnie

After shopping at the local butcher shop, I then visit the local banana vendor.  He is happy to sell me only the bananas that will work in my Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  Oh, he sells vanilla wafers, whip cream, and other banana related items, but he says that he can't believe it took this long to invent this.  I might add that I have put this device (don't dare call it a gadget) next to the egg scrambler that I received years ago from a friend.  You know, the egg scrambler that scrambled eggs with a needle that punctured the shell WITHOUT even cracking the egg.

My youngest son has always been a very picky eater and we could not get him to eat fruits, which as you know are essential to a balanced diet. We tried everything and he wouldn't eat and fruit unless it was cut up in bite size chunks. To make matters worse, he is also OCD so when you put the cut up fruit in front of him, he would line it up and any pieces that didn't match the one next to it he would refuse to eat, so needless to say he was not getting his daily allowance. Then when we could trick him and put sliced bananas in his cereal bowl before he inspected them, the unevenness of the slices caused to much or too little cereal and milk to be in the spoon and it was rejected. I even tried different sized spoons, but his OCD kicks in and he would line them all in order of size and he would only pick one spoon from either end because leaving a gap in the line just wasn't an option for him. Then I got the Hutzler 571 and with the perfect cuts every time he gets just the right mix of fruit, milk and cereal every spoonful! He is now strong, healthy and eats bananas all day long.

Portion control is very important when divvying up hard to find...meat...among friends. The device also makes a plaintive hum when the frozen winds pass through it, that is comforting and haunting all at once.

This is a far superior product.  When you switch the slicer into slice mode it begins to move my hands off of the counter, targets my bananas, and slices them precisely the way I want.  The only trouble is that it is difficult to turn off nad may result in slicing to many bananas.  I made the mistake of turning it on at my local grocery store.  Big mistake.

1894,1394,1394,3.0,26 Apr 2013,"I purchased the Hutzler 571 B/C deluxe set with both left and right curved cutters and the 571 S banana cutter sharpener.  The cutters worked well as known by both certified, professional and amateur operators.  However, as we all know, after cutting one or two hundred bananas the acid in the banana juice degrades the efficiency of the cutter blades.  The preponderance of my bananas were right curved and, in what seemed a very short time, the banana cutter efficiency and sharpness of cut were clearly degrading.  I got out the sharpener expecting to return the cutter to new cutter condition.  The sharpener performance was disappointing.  About half way through the blades the sharpener began to make an odd noise.  It appeared that the self-cleaning feature was not working and the blade filings were interrupting operations.  After manually moving the sharpener through the remainder of the cutter blades, I made a test cut and the results were poor.  It was evident that the blades sharpened before the sharpener had problems were operating properly, but the blades after that were not returned like new condition.  As a result, the dull side cut more slowly than the sharp side resulting in curved cuts on the sharp blade end.  It seems Hutzler was counting on the 670 series with the ceramic blades that would never need sharpening for the life of the product.  When the 670 prototype failed the FDA food safety crash test it seems Hutzler had no backup plan and were left backing a sharpener product they clearly know is inferior.",Van D. Underwood

On a small dessert plate (salad plates or even coffee cup saucers will do), arrange the perfectly cut banana slices in a circle around the outer edge.  Using your 229 Ice Cream Scooper, create a mound of your favorite ice cream, and place it in the center of the plate, inside the banana slices.  Top with a maraschino cherry.  It's so simple, and so elegant!  My family loves it.  And if you're serving dieters, you can substitute sorbet for the ice cream.  For a really decadent treat, drizzle chocolate sauce (I like Ghirardelli) over the ice cream.  A hint--the 571 works best with bananas that are a little on the firm side.  If your bananas are soft, rub the 571 with a little vegetable oil before slicing.

My only complaint is that they haven't invented a similar product for taking the kernels off of corn cobs. You see, I LOVE corn. I love everything ABOUT corn. I love to drown it in butter and salt and and eat it right off the cob. I love it creamed. I love it scraped right off the cob, too!! But it's just too darn much work to use a knife and to have to go 'round and 'round the cob until all the kernels have been removed. A device that would remove ALL the kernels in one felled swoop would be ideal. Every year I host a sweet corn eating party on the day of the Daytona 500, and I invite friends over to celebrate with me. We stand outside and eat corn and anger the neighbors who have been eating bowl after bowl of chili all winter long. It's a grand ol' time. Anyway...back to the banana slicer. It's great.

By far the biggest challenge for us is slicing up bananas.  We literally spend 80% of our time cutting up bananas.  The problem is, when in your in space you can't put too much in your mouth at once because the pressure differences mean you cant swallow as much.  So we try to cut them up into smaller equal sized pieces. Thing is, when we cut them up with a knife they just fly everywhere, and we never know how big to make the next slice because the slice that came before it is off by the orbital controls and comm. link.  When we heard about the Hutzler 571 we were pretty excited. We ordered it some time ago and just got it when the SpaceX capsule made its supply run a little but ago.  Man, when we first used it we looked like a bunch of little kids who just found out they got a snow day off from school. It freed up so much time, we finally got around to fixing the pressure lock. The suits put in for 10 more in this year's budget, but sequestration meant that we had to cut it down to 8.  This thing has survived in space for a month now, and is clearly built to last.

I eventually came upon the 571 Banana Slicer; henceforth, my lives problems have been solved. Don't get me wrong; I am still an under-paid and over-educated cubical dweller, whose daily highlight is regurgitating mediocre jokes from The Big Bang Theory around the water cooler, but now I have a device that simplifies the arduous task of slicing bananas or any generally phallic fruit.  My previous method of slicing bananas using a Rube Goldberg machine initiated by a whistle calling forth an Umpa-Lumpa and ending with a multitude of butcher knives falling from my ceiling to the tune of Khachaturian's ""Sabre Dance"" has been greatly simplified.

So you think you can just slice a banana with a regular knife? Sure. That may be fine but have fun wiping banana guts off it and having to clean another utensil later. Okay, so you're not concerned about dishes. That's fine. What about equal portions of split banana. Everyone assumes they can cut fairly even but does this product not scream OCD? In one swift move, the banana is suddenly cut into 16ish evenly cut slices (depending on length of banana). What about the other uses in the kitchen? Excusing pots and pans, this can: stir, drain, measure length, and when twisted, turn your Hutzler 571 into physical DNA model any science teach would be proud. But wait, there's more! On the off chance an intruder comes into your home and wants to steal your freshly cut banana slices, the Hutzler 571 can transform into a shank perfect for fending off the hungry criminal.

Unfortunately, after reading the reviews and studying the photos, I see that it is necessary to peel the banana before slicing it! Since my horse prefers the peel still on, this would actually increase the time I spend slicing his bananas as I would first need to peel the banana, then slice the inner part in one stroke with this product, but still be faced with slicing the peel by hand! I'd like to see a heavy-duty model with blades that could slice through the banana peel and all.

Either make them in red or purple or maybe even a simple clap and beep mechanism where you clap and it beeps so you can easily find it. If you don't have teeth, it might be ok anyway because there'd be nothing to break. I don't understand why they just can't make it in red or purple - no one's cutting beans with it, right?

A few months after I bought my Three-Wolf-Moon T-shirt, I was a happy man. A wolfman. Within my territory, I had the best single wide trailer on cinder blocks you could dream of.  My neighbors were becoming jealous at the steady flow of angry women entering and leaving my abode.  When I got the court papers citing that I was a public nuisance, I knew it was because the other women in the park, you know, the ones that fell to me early, were too overwrought with the sheer power of my Amazonian savvy.  Well, this wolfman had found out one thing: this steady stream of women liked to use my kitchen knives for just about everything.  This rare breed of pure woman would like to scratch their names into my custom fashioned particle-board window covers, or would try to use them in our angry/makeup relations in new and various ways.  In order to protect the pack, I had to get rid of all the knives.  My favorite wolf-man meal includes bananas. Don't judge me! I dip them into aged bacon grease (the same stuff I use for my awesome hair), and them swirl them in some good fluffernutter. Well you see, I could not eat properly without my handy knives around to cut the bananas. I tried everything else, all 17 of my cats, my dragon-canes, even my super sweet lightsabers would not do the job.  This wolfman was losing his energy so I became desperate and consulted the almighty bible of problem solving....The as-seen-on-TV commercials told me nothing.  I was stumped...but then, one day as I was walking I tripped over a cat and found myself face to face with my old box that my shirt came in.....it called to me...""Amazon"".  I knew what I had to do, so I typed in Banana.  It took a while since the computers at the library have trouble accepting my power, so I had to ask one of the librarians to spell it for me.  You heard it, she's a witch, she needed a SPELL to get this to work.  Don't judge me, I had to do this.  I immediately found what I needed, the banana slicer, and after I borrowed some money from my grandmother in the ""home"", I bought it.  When it came in, I was eager to try it out, I was starving!  The only problem is that it would not work! The unit was at the wrong angle, it was made wrong.  I sent it back.  Amazon acted quickly and sent another....I guess this happens a lot. After 10 more episodes repeating this, I finally accepted that I would have to make do.  The sides are blunt so that are no good for slicing.....so I thought of this:  Now I can wear my super stretchy-fake-leather pants, and I can carry this around for my friends to use.  Oh no, I don't have pockets, so I have to e gangsta, and fit it down my front.  The ladies LOVE it!  Wal-mart.....here I come again!  Wolfman out!",Wolfman

2097,1597,1597,1.0,25 Jan 2013,"no stranger to disappointment, I dutifully did my research before choosing just the right tool for my often complex banana slicing needs. I read the reviews on this product as well as several others such as the death banana 3000, the monkey' s friend, and the often overlooked yet highly effective pointy stick. seeing as the reviews for this particular product were so overwhelmingly favorable, I took a leap of faith and ordered it. my first impression was quite positive as I eagerly removed the gleaming yellow modern miracle from its protective packaging. I also locked the doors and closed all the curtains because I had mistakenly mentioned to a neighbor that I was expecting the banana slicer to arrive today. I probably should have paid attention to the fact that his hands were heavily bandaged and that when I said the word ""banana"" he turned an alarmingly livid purple color and began wringing his hands (until he screamed in pain).  anyway, now that I was safely ensconced inside my home, I began experimenting with my new technological wonder. What a tremendous ripoff! I placed the banana slicer among the bananas and then washed my hands. When I turned back around, the slicer had vanished! who the heck thought making a banana slicer the same color as the bananas would be a good idea? I finally found the darn thing by slicing my ring finger not once but six times in equally spaced slashes, and then discovered that wouldn't cut through the peels! Someone please show me where in the instructions it gives that little tidbit! So I struggled with those pesky yellow skins myself and then prepared to finally use this so-called time saver. What do you know? It turns out that not all bananas are the same size and shape! If the bananas were too small, the slicer scratched my kitchen counter. If the bananas were too large, the slicer only sliced part of the banana, leaving me to do the rest. I honestly would have returned it, but I was saved the trouble by my neighbor who just happened to be at my mailbox later that afternoon. Be warned! This banana slicer really is too good to be true!",Kathleen M. Ayotte

2100,1600,1600,1.0,27 Sep 2012,"First, I hated to give this a one star review because it slices bananas like a champ.  Like several have already mentioned, it only works on bananas that are curved the same direction as the Hutzler.  This might seem like a big deal, but it's really not. During an extensive three day testing period, I found that about half of the 1200 bananas were curved in the right direction.  This should work fine for the average consumer that eats half of his or her bananas and uses the other half in their cereal.  Also, these should work well for the local school district which is now mandated to give 3 banana slices as part of a larger 125 calorie lunch per the new rules from Michelle O.  So what's not to love?  After you use this thing to give you beautiful, symmetrically sliced bananas, it's got to be washed and that is the rub.  It claims to be dishwasher safe, but boy, did I learn better.  I loaded what I thought was a well engineered product into my dishwasher, pushed start, headed into the living room to watch a Lifetime Network Victims Movie marathon and that's when the trouble started.  After about 5 minutes, I heard a small explosion and snapped around in time to see a small mushroom cloud rising above my dishwasher.  This frightened the cat which had been laying there and he shot across the room with the last three inches of his tail on fire.  Howling like... well, like a howler monkey, he bounced off three walls and then knocked over a vial of sulfuric acid that was sitting on my end table.  We won't get into why I had the sulfuric acid there, but Google 'home removal of venereal warts' to get a better idea.  Anyway, the acid burned a hole through my linoleum and cost me four future treatments.  Bottom line, if you buy one of these things, be prepared to wash it by hand.",Countrysquire

As a matter of fact, I still have a brand new CHIQUITA-BLADE, unused, in the ORIGINAL packaging (now a collector's item if anyone out there is interested.)

It's a dream to use, combining the elegant lines of the YAKAMICHI 4000 POWERSLICER with the speed and power of the PEDLOW ULTRA-NANA -- with the all the flash and sizzle we've come to expect from HUTZLER. They've also eliminated a lot of the shim and wobble from the previous 570 model that sometimes tended to mush the end pieces ever-so-slightly. Some of my friends say HUTZLER has slipped in the past few years. That they don't care about quality banana slicing anymore -- ever since the Old Man suffered his stroke. But this product is proof-positive that Hank and Harry, Jr. are doing a great job of running the HUTZLER company -- and bringing lots of bold new ideas to the table (I L-O-V-E the new Plaintain Adapter!!!). Also, according to a news release from the company, they've totally upgraded the factory in Shanghai since the fire. So, as far as I'm concerned, even if Harry Sr. never makes it back to day-to-day operations, the 571 is proof-postive that the HUTZLER boys seem to have everything under control.

Now, God has, in his infinite wisdom, given us the perfectly designed implement to enjoy this gracious gift. As a Christian, I have always had some reservations about eating bananas as it seems far too sinful a sight. Now I don't have to worry at all because I can slice up that sinful shape into totally non-phallic slices of His love. You can also take two communion wafers and make little Christnana sandwiches.",normparadigm

2154,1654,1654,1.0,21 Sep 2012,"I recently found myself in the market for an effective ""banana"" slicing product. I had used a much more inefficient older model several years ago that, while ultimately effective, definitely needed some improvement. The previous model was somewhat clumsy and required me to use more of a ""sawing"" motion in order to sever...errr...slice the ""banana"", not to mention the need for vodka and a significant helping of sleeping pills...umm, as I was saying... This product looked to be a godsend; less arm strength required and you get more slices in one shot (which makes portability of the ""banana"" a non-issue). See, I personally feel very strongly that when one slices a ""banana"" one shouldn't have to settle for half-way. Honestly, if I can toss a sliced ""banana"" out of the window of a moving vehicle into, let's say, a roadside forest it shouldn't be able to be found again and REATTACHED as a WHOLE NEW BANANA...are you KIDDING ME!!! This product would make that virtually impossible - WINNING!! **AHEM** anyhoo, I would have liked to have given this excellent item a better rating but I had to go with just one star as it only comes in one size and I happen to need it a bit smaller *sigh*",L.

One of them learned how to read, and ordered the 571 out of a catalogue I left in my study one evening.

After what seemed like an eternity-long gaze into the box, she looked up at me and exclaimed ""I can't believe that you never noticed that I have TWO ears!!!""

Based on soil nutrient conditions, climate, and geographical location, bananas grow to different shapes as sizes.

The perfect lunch, to my mind, is a banana tucked in the front of my backpack with a packet of frozen edamame beans.  Over the morning, the beans chill the banana to ice cream temperature, and the contrast between the cool refreshing banana and the hot microwaved beans is to die for. But, up till now, I've had to peel the banana by hand.  Sometimes the stem is hard, and by squeezing too tightly I crush the banana's fragile tip.  Other times, the whole banana's gone soft and breaks in half while peeling.  When half the banana falls to the kitchen floor, I pick it up and eat it anyway, and then must bear the shame of having digested floor banana until another distraction helps me to forget.  Now, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, there is no problem.  I encase the banana, activate the razor sharp micro-blades, and wa-la!  Perfect slices, every time.

I purchased this banana slicer in mockery of the idea of its existence, yet came to grow fond of the product after numerous exposures to its simplicity. Who would have thought a banana slicer would slice bananas so slicey? The sliceyness of this banana slicer is unreal. One night, I woke up to my 2014 day old cat slicing up a ripe plantain in to her can of fancy feast! Plantains are so much bigger than bananas, yet a feline was able to slice it right up! Unfortunately a couple weeks later, my hound was threatening the cat with the banana slicer, until I intervened... ""Ole Rock! That dad gum banana slicer is made for slicing bananas, not cats! Come on, homeboy."" As Ole Rock wielded the slicer, he threw it in a boomerang-esque fashion only to precisely slice every sliceable banana in the room until the slicer softly returned to his paw.

I was starving.  My fingers had been blown off by a makeshift explosive.  I was dying. The only food I had was bananas.  But, by all things unholy, I couldn't get them into perfect bite size chunks!

The use of this ""Simple to use"" kitchen utensil took me hours to figure out and I am considered the formost expert on bannanna and the slicing. First you have to peel and figure out which way to lay your bannanna on a cutting surface. Then you have to figure in the strength and resistance of the bannanna. You may have to convert to or from metric depending on your model and where you live. Following this you must place it on top of the bannanna and line it up (this could take you up to an hour) then press with a medium steady pressure (too hard and your hand may slip causing uneven slicing and too soft the bannanna may resist cutting).

Unfortunately the banana slicer is unable to accommodate my bananas and I have to cut each banana before I can use the slicer, then the bananas get stuck, then I have to pop them out and then I have to slice them in half. This seems like a lot of extra work for something that was supposed to make my life easier.",M. Reiss

Brother Borris from St. Paul's cathedral downtown came over one day saw one on the floor thought it was a Loona Doone cracker and ate it.

During the space race, as the American and Russian programs came together, it was felt to be time to take this hidden technology to the next level.  If the German Scientists were capable of creating the first true rocket, known as the V-1 (not coincidentally, the ""V"" is short for Victorio - not many are aware of this), why not believe that it is truly possible to break the barrier that had kept the world from realizing that having a banana slicer in every home was not just a dream. So, in the early 90's, when much more of the worlds technologies were being shared, a rather excited group came together - and would from that day be known as The Victorio Study On  Banana Slicers.

I purchased solely based on the glowing reviews (I often purchase photography equipment based on Amazon reviews and I tried to apply that approach with the banana slicer).  I thought this would really capture the color in landscape shots (at least as good or better than the Sigma 30MM F1.4 that I currently use for outdoor shots) and it really failed to meet my expectations or work in general. I tried multiple adapters to get this to attach to the camera body and all failed miserably, I ended up having to just jam it into the reflex mirror housing and wrap in several layers of duct tape.  Unfortunately this damaged the slicer to the point it is nonreturnable and to top it off my camera is giving me ""error"" messages.  Never again.",Ray
2803,63,63,2.0,26 Apr 2016,"I was intrigued by this device as I am a staunch believer that cleanliness is close to Godliness. However, as a committed agnostic I find I am torn in this belief, for obvious reasons. Nevertheless I have purchased many items over the years with the sole aim of eradicating this planet of the multitude of microscopic (and macroscopic) swine that festoon the items we, as a race of parasitic scum hold dear to our hearts and, on this occasion, frequently ingest with porridge and a splash of maple syrup whilst listening to Radio 2 of a morning. There are moments in ones life when the true, abject horror of existing is smashed home like a cricket bat to the testes (e.g. the birth of a child (and subsequent cost), sitting through a Grand Prix, buying a miniature lemon and poppy seed muffin from Nero's and the resulting realisation that you have no money left to feed yourself (and said child) for the rest of the month etc.), but none more so than the very real prospect that the fruit we eat is riddled with disease. I speak not of the usual pesticides and herbicides and funkicides frequently associated with eating a genetically modified phallic yellow umbrella-handle - you can leave those complaints to the hairy-armpitted smelly-trump brigade who spend the majority of their lives cleaning their house with lemon juice instead of actual 'Jif' in some desperate attempt to appear cool and considerate. I am more concerned with the apparent vile propensity our fruit has for growing miniscule bugs that one would normally associate with working class children's greasy heads. I wasn't even aware that this was a problem, let alone one of such magnitude that it required a device, like the one you are peddling, to eradicate the danger of it from our lives. Also, and this may of course be a moot point as it seems obvious to me (now) that not every banana is infected with this revolting affliction, having tried the device on numerous occasions, I have to say that I have yet to find a single 'corpse' to suggest it was a worthy purchase. Whilst this has paid dividends towards my self-congratulatory need to keep my house and its contents 'spick and span', it has made me ponder over where my purchase was a waste of three quid, or to put it in layman's terms, the cost of the icing from a Nero's muffin. Maybe I'm not combing the banana in the correct fashion, but the gaps between each 'tooth' in the unit appear unnecessarily far apart for the requisite task?",Time Waster

Nowhere was I informed that this banana slicer that should have provided me with nicely and uniformly sliced bananas would not come with a single banana in the box.

Oh to my dismay, my banana was a genuine African banana that is most favored by the African Swallow as opposed to the European Swallow.  This may not mean anything until one realizes that the reason the African banana is favored by the African Swallow is due to the straighness of the banana as opposed to the curved banana shape provided by most European and Western Hemispherical bananas.  What a disappointment when my nice and perfectly straight banana did not conform to the contour of this utensil and was mashed at the top providing for a horrific banana horror movie type result.  The worst part is that not realizing or being warned that the slicer would slice in a curved manner, I managed to remove one digit from my left hand as I held down my banana.

It's a real disease people- look it up).

I will say due to it's sharp precision edges, the lines of flesh that I have to stitch back together are very straight, so that's a plus. Since putting the members back together doesn't always work, with infection etc, our Maternity Ward nurses have had less work and some have had to transfer to the ER to help rebuild members.

How can they not realize that, what may seem to be a joke to them, actually impacts a real person/people.  You have no idea how somebody's idea of a joke can destroy a persons real dreams and aspirations ... or worse.  I do.  I went to Cal Tech, for computer science, and worked in one of the student groups developing our own software for our major.  One of the ways we tested our project was to, literally, play blackjack.  Our project's advisor said that he was speaking at a symposium and that that year it was going to be held in Vegas.  He said, ""You should come with, for fun.""  We thought, cool! and we all saved up and/or got money from our folks for the trip.  At the end of June we headed to Vegas. All of us were new at blackjack up to that year, and you know what our advisor told us?  That, in Vegas, when you play blackjack you're supposed to count, out loud, ""One, two, three, four ..."" as the dealer deals each card.  I don't know how we all completely missed that nobody else was doing this, but there we were, the first night, sitting around the blackjack table doing just what that SOB told us to.  Well, the dealer stopped about half way through the deck, as we were counting like that, and said, ""hold on"".  Then, two guys in business suits showed up and said ""come with us"".  WE WERE TAKEN IN BACK AND BEATEN TO WITHIN INCHES OF OUR LIVES.  So go ahead, write your little stories, real funny, ha ha.",Light Entropy

I had tried a butchers knife, but the sections always came out un-even. I had even tried getting the electric meat slicer, but that disrupted the veins. Then I heard about  Hutzler 571 Banana slicer!

When I got home ready to end my life I saw 12.5 banana slicers on my table! Naturally I called my friend she was amazed she also had 12.5 banana slicers at her home! Who did this heartfelt good deed? We rejoiced and be began slicing bananas left and right. Now we no longer have to deal with the pain and heartbreak brought on by manually slicing bananas was no more!

3842,1102,1102,1.0,11 Sep 2015,The Hutzler 571 is a banana slicer. It is not a Hutzler product it is made in China. Like come on that is ridiculous. And it comes in only one color. YELLOW. disgusting yellow why not any other color besides YELLOW. And where will you find that big of a banana!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would they put a growth hormone in the banana to make it grow that big ughhhh. And it costs like $5 for a stinkin thing that can bend when you touch it. Also if you press your hand to hard on that stinkin banana slicer it will make marks in your hands or even cut you.,Tera Allen

No more throwing bananas to the cat so they would get sliced.  Now I have placed 300 orders for these and they make great gifts!  I sent one to my boss and he said ""you're fired"" and I said ""ok"" and I died! It's as easy as that.  I hope they update the software on this banana slicer, its getting kind of out of date.  The processer seems a little slow and the buttons lag.  I caught my neighbor trying to STEAL my banana slicer, but you don't have to worry about her anymore, I put her in jail lol.  Also, I climbed mount everest using this ingenius device as my walking stick!

Imagine my excitement the day I received my 571B Banana Slicer in the mail!!!  Unfortunately, it didnt take long for me to realize that big things do not come in small packages.  Apparently the company got my address mixed up or something because it clearly says on the side of the 571B Banana Slicer ""Made in China"".  Its a well known fact that Chinese people have much smaller fruit than we have here in America so I understand the need for the standard size.  But we are Americans!

I worked a 12 hour shift just to come home to THIS?!"" These are the things that can destroy an entire relationship. It got to the point where our children could sense the tension.

The occasional rogue banana would complicate my morning routine so--banana slicer to the rescue.  I find this works best on cocktail bananas.  Why?  Don't know.  The magic just happens.  But the 2 stars are for 2 significant reasons.  While going through security at the airport, my banana slicer was permanently detained under suspicion of it being a WMD.  I did not suspect this kitchen gadget had been used as weaponry.  Had I been warned I never would have taken Bob (every slicer should have its own name) with me. Not everyone knows these slicers can be used a weaponry, therefore, I strongly feel they should come with a warning.  Second reason for the 2 star review.......So, today I went to order Bob's replacement and the price went from $3.50 to $8.95!!!! This should be illegal, and I am beyond chagrined.  It's great for $3.50--a total rip off for $8.95.  Based on the price I do not recommend.  I was looking forward to meeting Bob's replacement.  But for $8.95 it will be forever just a dream.

Overall it's just okay, but it does let me cut bananas up faster.  The ""blades"" are a bit weak/flimsy as if I'm not careful the blades bend and I get uneven slices.  Also, the blades are a bit too deep or long and as a result I waste time trying to get the slices out.  I've used it twice now and it's now sliced up about 150 bananas.  Were I asked to change the design to make it better...I'd make it with shorter blades.  Shorter blades might be more rigid for more even slices and allow for the slices to be extracted faster.  Lastly, for a dehydrator the slices are a bit on the thick side so they take longer than when I was slicing by hand.  That said they do turn out well!  Overall an okay item.",AER

She loves to eat bananas now and she, and ONLY she, can cut them.  She informed me that the banana slicer will cut carrots, chicken, and crackers.  I still remain skeptical.  It is such a silly thing that has made her very happy and given her some independence.  I quite often catch her just cutting a banana for a snack on the counter or the kitchen table.  No plate, no towel.  So what if it is messy for me to clean up, at least she is eating well.  I just toss it in the dishwasher.

No more carefully making sure each slice is sliced straight and precisely the same size as the previous slice.  This slicer does it for you.

I had been buying him bananas for years, but have never been there when he eats them. I assumed he ate them like any normal human being, by peeling them and biting them, but I was wrong. He slices them into thin, equally spaced slices, and then eats them with a fork. It's probably pretty judgmental of me, but I think this is weird. He does have a ""thing"" where he likes to use as many dishes as possible to prepare and/or eat any given food, so maybe it's part of that? I mean, why you would need to dirty a knife, a fork, and a plate to eat a banana is beyond me, but I've learned to stop pointing out how dumb the things he does are and just live with them.

Unless you're catering a party that needs hundreds of bananas evenly sliced, you won't need a banana slicer. And, if you are going to slice hundreds of bananas, you will need a better banana slicer. This molded plastic slicer gets the job halfway done, at which point you have to push the remaining part of the banana through the rest of the slicer. You then have to clean bits of banana residue stuck to the insides of the molding and then wash the sucker. Much easier all around to simply have used a sharp knife.

There are times when too much banana residue has built up and it no longer slices in an uniform manner. No product manual came with this item and I am strongly considering taking a training class. I have been getting very frustrated with being unable to understand the people available on the help line. I try to go through my troubleshooting process with them and they want to start from the beginning of their ""checklist""!!! They are simply not grasping the issue I am having. I am not stupid and can troubleshoot the basics here!!! I just wanted what was advertised. I want to slice a banana with one quick motion. This has become challenging with the slippery feel. In fact this product is starting to smell a bit as well. Who ever thought it could produce slightly crunchy slices? Is this an undocumented feature or a defect. NOONE CAN TELL ME!!

My uneven slicing caused me so much grief and anxiety that I was unable to leave my home for the past 20 years and have since lived with my parents.  I earn a meager living working out of my parents' basement reviewing pyrimid schemes for home based businesses and writing warnings about them on various web sites.  Thanks to Facebook, I am able to keep up with the outside world and recently changed by status to ""in a relationship"" with a one handed lawyer I met in a chat room.  Although we have never met in person we chat every day on FB and even have plans to Skype.  I was up late one night, I usually can't fall asleep easily since I still hear the taunts that were hurled at my growing up about my banana slicing skills.  The children were especially fond of singing ""Lucy Lucy you can't slice and you will never ever be a mans wife.""  Through my tears I looked up at the television screen and saw the most wonderful product on an informative info mercial.  I was skeptical but desperate.  The days awaiting its arrival were an eternity and I won't lie as sucidal thoughts did cross my mind.  Finally the postman delivered this amazing God send.  I prayed silently before attempting my first banana in over 20 years.  I was also heavily medicated and had prepared myself for dissapointment and another 20 years of living in my parents basement which occasionally floods.  Tears of gratitude flowed from my eyes as I sliced the much despised yellow fruit.  ""Shock"" is the only word that can describe the results as I stared in disbelief at the perfect slices.  Yes, I said ""PERFECT"" slices.

4277,1537,1537,2.0,02 Jan 2015,"If ever a product was misnamed, this is certainly the one. The question is: was this intentionally done by the Hutzler people or are they just completely ignorant to history? Let me provide some background. Like a majority of American baby-boomer children, I grew up in a house that staunchly promoted the new post-war 5-5-3 banana cutting configuration. Of course, this refers to 5 small slices, 5 medium slices, and 3 slightly larger slices. This was developed in early-1947 as a direct repudiation of the 3-4-6 approach that was so favored by our grandparents‚Äô generation, and had been in use since the early 1800s.  That arrangement  was created in the Russian shtetls to show the Tsar that, even though they were poor peasants, the people could still slice their bananas the way they wanted, and that they could have as many large pieces as they chose!  This turned out to be a largely symbolic gesture, though, as fresh bananas were quite rare in the 19th century Pale (and beyond).  Anyway, the 5-5-3 approach was a clean break (no pun intended) with the past. So when I saw the Hutzler 571 advertised, I assumed that this was the Millennials‚Äô bid to take their rightful place in the banana-cutting saga.  ‚ÄúFinally‚Äù, I thought (using the proper mental quotes), ‚Äúa generation that not only wants to leave its mark, but is doing so with a precision tool.‚Äù  Not wanting to be labeled an ‚Äúold fogey‚Äù, I immediately placed an order for one.  It arrived at my door soon after, and I opened the package with trembling hands. I carefully placed it over my banana, and pressed down as instructed.  Then I stood back in horror. No! This cannot be. 1, 2, 3, 4‚Ä¶..18 slices!!!!  And all of about the same size.  I quickly checked the package.  Yes‚Ä¶it does say ‚ÄúHutzler 571‚Äù. 571! 5-7-1. 13!  The ordained 13 of our ancestors.  Not 18. 13!  Hutzler: is this some sort of a scam?  Needless to say, I have returned this blasphemous product and will continue using my beloved 5-5-3 method by hand.",oneworld

Before long, the whole town knew of my banana challenged ways. I was the laughing stock of playgroup. Kicked off the PTA, banned from classroom parties and shunned at bake sales.

They gave me this beautiful product and begged that I just TRY it. I resisted. How could I let some plastic contraption make up for my huge banana based inadequacies?  Week 1 -- remove from package. Week 2 - leave on counter and have stare down. Week 3- touch it...gasp!  But by week 4, I was ready to slice my first banana. It was glorious. Angels sang, the heavens parted and all was right with the world. My drinking problem is gone, my husband stopped cheating on me with Mary Ann and my kids no longer have to hang their heads in curved shame. Thank you Hutzler for saving my life and giving me some dignity. As for the other play group moms, well lets just say no one knows my pretty little secret but everyone in town knows that THIS lady sure knows how to handle a banana.

When attempting to slice the banana, it mostly just crushes the fruit, making a mess of smashed banana on the counter.  However, when combined with an orange peeling tool, one can remove the outer shell of the banana before applying the Hutzler 571.  That way, it works great and makes perfect slices every time!  Now, I would rate this product 5 stars if only Hutzler would include the obviously needed companion tool for removing the tough outer shell.

Unfortunately, due to its curvature, about half of the time it's the wrong shape for my bananas, resulting in a tremendous waste. (Nearly HALF of the bananas I peel have to be discarded or eaten whole because they curve the wrong way for the Hutzler 571 slicer.) It would be nice if they offered these in a ""matched pair"" set, one curved to the left and the other curved to the right, instead of the right-curved one only. It seems that the entire world is biased against left-handed anythings, this being the latest example of this prejudice in design, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing. I mean really, would it have been that hard to offer both? And they could have doubled their sales, too. When it works, it works great (5 stars), but when it doesn't, it's a total waste.

I can put it in the sole of my shoe or in my back pocket and I tell you that you will be well prepared to take on the day!  One piece of advice is to briefly freeze the banana for easier slicing.

I use bags that are marked ""medical waste"".. 4) Soak the slicer in bleach water for 10 minutes prior to use. 5) Get out the rubber gloves girls (no, not those rubber gloves, they stay in the nightstand), and get ready to slice! 6) Pick up BOTH ends of the slicer, using 2 hands (you can grasp the stem end with either hand, just be certain it matches the lay of the banana on the cutting board). 7) Push down into the banana firmly, keeping your focus on taking the entire slicer all the way down to the cutting board (otherwise you will just have ""fanned banana"" not true slices. 8) Lift the slicer carefully out of the banana slices, taking care to not disturb their order or to rotate them in any way. 9) Enjoy! 10) Remember to clean EVERYTHING with bleach water and sit it all in the sun for 5 hours before storing.",John Korkow

Sadly after it arrived I realized that no one mentioned how this slicer handles the embarrassing problem of the banana strings.  This is particularly important in a mixed marriage situation.  My husband likes to eat the strings and I abhor them.  The directions which would otherwise be quite helpful mention nothing about the strings.  Keep in mind that if you leave the strings on and then use this device, you will no longer have strings, just shreds. That distressed my husband greatly, and he has threatened to ""permanently dispose"" of the slicer.  Now I must find a new and unique location to hide the slicer every single day. Our marriage counselor has advised that my husband just pull the strings off and eat them whole before using the slicer, which sounds like good advice to me.  He does not like that solution.

The manufacturer has yet to disclose how it manages to remove and discard the peel, prompting competitors to start reverse engineering initiatives in order to fabricated the process within their own product lines.  A competitor was heard to comment: ""WTF! Hutzler's done it again!""  The floor at the CES will be abuzz with anticipation and speculation that the 700 Series will be Bluetooth compatible as well.  Hutzler representative's have stated that the 700 Series is not intended to replace the classic 571 line, and there are no plans to sunset this favorite of households and gourmet chefs alike.

Only some of my bananas fit perfectly in the slicer, but many just turn into mashed banana when I try to cram them into the rigid plastic frame.  So if I want to slice my too-big banana properly, I have to take out a piece of metal with a sharpened edge and a handle (a ""knife"") and carve the banana into thinner, shorter or straighter portions so it will fit into the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.",A reader
4378,1638,1638,1.0,06 Jan 2013,"I know you guys generally love this thing, but I did find a couple of downsides.  While it does save time slicing the bananas, I find that I'm spending a lot of time holding it up to individual bananas at the grocery store to see if they match the shape of the slicer.  And of course, that involves breaking off the bananas from the bunches.  The produce manager seems to frown on that.  Sometimes in breaking the banana off the stem, I've accidently started to unpeel it.. a real moral dilemma.  ""You broke it, you bought it?""  Sometimes I just tuck it in the back of the bunch, especially if it's shape does not match the slicer anyway.  I can't buy every banana I handle....it would cost a fortune.  I tried slipping the damaged one into my pocket, but, well, one nice older lady screamed and ran from me screaming ""pervert.""  However, some other very nice individuals (male and female) smled and gave me the ""call me"" hand sign.  So, I tried eating the damaged bananas while standing there... I fully intended to take the coded peels to the register and check them out on u-scan.  After all, once you start to peel them, they turn black and squishy.  The store manager didn't seem to like that idea, but I bought 5 issues of the National Inquier to make up for it (Jusin Bieber is really an alien?)",Wizdude

Bananas are great for you, but if you just don't want to eat the dang things like a monkey, what can one do? After years of slaving over a cold paper plate with a butter knife, laboriously slicing my bananas, I thought I could finally relax. One slice, and...viola! The WHOLE banana is sliced! Sadly, I quickly discovered a problem: in only slices about half--maybe less on a bad day!--of the bananas I have. I have been unable to slice the left-facing bananas with this tool, so I only save half the amount of time I had hoped to save. Maybe if the company can offer a left-facing banana slicer, I can slice all my bananas and eat them, too. Or is it cake? Well, I can tell you, bananas or cake, or banana-cream cake...dang it, now I'm hungry! Anyway, banas or cake, you can slice it whichever way you want, but this product didn't quite live up to my expectations.

When he was caught and locked up in Sing-Sing, he kept escaping his cell, cell 571.  Other nearby prisoners finally admitted (under torture) that Mr. Hutzler was able to squeeze out through the bars. The warden was so angry, that he replaced the cell bars with thin sharp blades a mere quarter inch apart and vowed to recapture the slippery convict. Mr. Hutzler was caught again and returned to cell 571. Unfortunately no opening in the bars for food was allowed, so it was nearly impossible to feed Mr. Hutzler. He grew so thin, the warden feared another break out. As a last resort the warden shoved a banana through the bars which fell through in perfect slices and proved to be irresistible to Mr. Hutzler. The warden served him bananas for every meal after that, until 6 weeks later Mr. Hutzler died from excess potassium.

While camping, I thought I would have been able to slice fresh Aussie bananas with it, but I couldn't.  All that I could use it for was a makeshift boomerang, though it was a pretty bad one at that.

After years of waiting and wondering what kind of deliciousness lie beneath that seemingly impenetrable exterior came a beacon of light in an otherwise pitch black existence - Banana Slicer.  After seeing the 571B on Amazon I nearly broke down crying I was so excited.  I purchased immediately and anticipated it's arrival for what seemed like months.  Unable to restrain myself, I went to the grocery store to purchase bushel after bushel of the yellow ambrosia finally having the confidence I would be able to uncover the glory residing within.  The tracking label slated its arrival on the morning I had a big meeting with a potential client.  I called into work sick.  This unveiling could wait no longer.  I sat in the garage all morning and met the Fed Ex driver at his truck to sign for the box.  I felt just like Ralph from A Christmas Story opening the box containing his long awaited BB Rifle.  I already had the banana lying in wait on the cutting board.  I removed the twist tie backing to the package and removed the 571B holding it in my shaky anxious hand as if I was Arthur wielding Excalibur.  I carefully placed it atop the banana and pushed down as directed.  SQUISH!  Convinced I must have had a bad banana the first time I grabbed one off a different bushel, placed it on the board, again applied pressure to the Banana Slicer. SQUISH!  What the hell! Nanner after nanner after nanner all same result.  After reading so many reviews I was hopeful that a solution finally existed but based on the $20 price tag I should have known better.  The cheap plastic material the 571B is constructed of is simply no match for the coconut-like exterior shell surrounding this mysterious fruit.  I suppose this is one fruit whose secrets are only to be known by the monkeys and great apes holding the keys to unlocking them.

Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure accuracy. 2. Rinse banana slicer under the tap to begin cleaning process. 3. Scrub gently with kitchen scrub brush to loosen large particles. 4. Rinse again. 5. Use a toothbrush dedicated for this purpose ONLY to loosen smaller particles of banana flesh 6. Rinse. 7. Put banana slicer in a vice. 8. Get eighteen Heritage 7 Interdental Brushes 8. Dip brush in diluted dishwashing detergent and use one brush to clean only one segment of the Banana Slicer. NOTE: DO NOT attempt to re-use a brush on another segment. Trust me, it's not pretty. 9.

We started digging through the banana goo and finally found it, but by then it wouldn't ring anymore, and we had lost the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the bananas. My daughter and her husband stopped by after my phone went dead and they helped us shovel out the house.  We dumped the whole mess in the compost heap.  I expect the Banana Slicer is in there somewhere.  Maybe it will turn up next spring when I go to fertilize the tomatoes.",Delia
4417,1677,1677,5.0,02 May 2013,"After slicing through my third finger while trying to quickly cut through a banana that was a little too ripe, I decided I'd had enough! I knew what I needed, just didn't know which slicer would actually do the job, I mean think about it; cutting a banana is pretty laborious and dangerous work. Not a task for the weak and weary. So I started my research. I scoured hundreds of websites and read thousands of reviews. I would have eye strain and fatigue from going through all technical specs and various info on the many different slicers available. But the fear of slicing that next banana tomorrow morning kept me up most nights and I was loosing a great deal of sleep, it started to really effect my health. So there I was, website after website, review after review. I mean you've got: The Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer, The Fox Run Banana Slicer, The Banana Magic Kitchen Tool, The Amco 3 in 1 Banana Split Tool, The Garden Fresh Banana Slicer, The Martha Stewart Banana Slicer, The Nana Slicer, The Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP, The Evriholder Nana Slicer, The Boon Nanner Hand-Held Banana Slicer, etc. You've got your gold plated slicers, nickel plated slicers, plastic slicers, and of course the knock off's (but who wants those). So I read, and read, and read.. and finally, after what seemed like months (was probably just a few weeks) of reading and research, I FINALLY came across THE ONE... The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!!!! I purchase this slicer and couldn't be happier. This thing is absolutely amazing! No more sliced up/off fingers anymore. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could use some extra instructions as the instructions it comes with are rather vague. Be warned it does come with a pretty steep learning curve, but let me tell you, it's well worth it! As you learn to use this device, just keep pressing through and you'll get the hang of it before long.",Sam

It is definitely one of those ""love it or hate it"" kinds of items, as its blatant social commentary and its prominence in the political rhetoric of our times have divided people all over the nation.  True, there are some things about the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer that we can all agree upon.  It is yellow.  It does the work of ten men.  But from there, we devolve into debates on good taste (is it art?  what IS art?), morality (what will the neighbors think?) and the American work ethic (what does it say about me if I'm too lazy to chop bananas by hand?).  I myself fall into the ""love it"" camp, but I can understand why many others feel differently.  Its warfare uses have tarnished its prestigious reputation immeasurably, and we will only know the true significance of this iconic product in retrospect.",marymi
4421,1681,1681,2.0,18 Jan 2013,"Okay, it's a decent enough product but what the people at Hutzler don't want you to know is that this is the bottom of the line product. If you look carefully on the MTV show ""Cribs"", especially the episodes featuring Jay-Z and Little Wayne, you will see the model that they only offer to celebrity clients, the Hutzler 572PD. The PD stands, of course, for platinum and diamonds. As anyone who has studied metallurgy, gemology and their relative comparative effect on tropical fruit (c1932 Cambridge, MA)knows that a platinum and diamond banana slicer will go through a banana at almost twice the speed of ordinary plastic and do so in ultimate style. Sure, with a suggested retail price of $97,499.99 plus $2.99 shipping and handling, it is certainly a luxury household item but so are Shroud of Turin dish cloths and carbon fiber toilet paper both of which are, incidentally, offered on Amazon and with FREE Super Saver shipping. Sorry to say that the elitists at Hutzler have reserved their best and, as aforementioned, most efficient product for multi millionaires and have chosen not to make them available to the general public.  Why not allow US to decide whether we prefer a well-optioned BMW 750lxi or a platinum and diamond encrusted banana slicer?

Maybe the rest of you haven't thought of this, but I used a sharpie (fine point) to help me in outlining the exterior of the banana so I would know where to cut it. The banana I used was too big, so I improvised as best I could. The rest of the banana that didn't fit into the dimensions of the template I simply threw away. My husband was impressed.

My life is changed forever. I would suggest including instructions, though; it took me an hour to figure out which way to place the banana. And there should be a disclaimer.

As a graduation gift my sweet old granny gave me the 532Z that she carried through the Normandy Invasion (automatic).  All was well with the world.  Then President Obama came into the picture and started outlawing semi auto banana slicers.  Someone could be hurt he said, we have to control the right of the people to slice things they said.  Someone could leave one of these in their trunk while commiting a crime and then the news could change the facts and trick an entire country into giving up their banana slicing rights if we're not careful here folks!!  What if this fell into the hands of a madman?  Its not like we can go back in time and return to the days when Americans could handle slicing bananas with knives, or working, or being responsible adults, or voting for responsible eligible citizens to lead the country.  Over the years I was forced to register my 532 and get an ATF tax stamp.  Then the government started taxing my banana purchases at an alarming rate.  I didnt even know what had happened until it was already too late.  I guess it all just happened over time and now looking back we were all tricked!!!  The kids down the block think it is just the way things have always been, I remember the good ol days of unabated banana slicing as a free American.  Ever try slicing a banana with a ten round slicer....NO FUN, I eventually got proficient enouph with my ten round slicer that I could still cut just as fast, but I felt that my rights were being trampled on by a tricky illigal alien who had been wrongly elevated to leader of the free world and his menacing white haired associate.  The 571 has been the perfect answer to my banana slicing funk.  I can now slice my bananas into 25 slices without reloading.

I ordered it and awaited its arrival for days. I purchased a bunch of bananas in advance that awaited the arrival of the Hutzler 571. I even called out of work to make sure I was home when the package arrived. The moment it was dropped off I ran to the kitchen with the box. As I ripped open the box you can imagine my disappointment when I noticed it was more lemon-yellow than banana-yellow. Tears brimmed my eyes as I began to fear that a lemon-yellow slicer would never slice bananas. I decided to pull myself together and give it a try. I peeled the first banana, and with shaking hands began the first attempt of slicing bananas. To my relief it worked! I couldn't believe it. A lemon-yellow slicer actually sliced a banana. I decided to keep the Hutzler 571, but I still can't help but wonder if a banana-yellow slicer would be a more efficient slicer. Perhaps the company will address this in order to prevent any other temporarily broken hearts. If this happened to you when you purchased your Hutzler, fear not, it still slices!",Kristin

Its shape makes it a perfect template for tracing out ""banana charts"" for my marketing classes!  Fast, consistent drawings, every time.  I know most humans in the business world are more comfortable with pie charts, bar charts, line charts, or histograms; but no shape holds the attention of a matriculating young chimp like the banana.  They stay positively captivated, and since I started using the Hutzler for preparing class lectures, student exam scores are up 50 percent (that's 9 segments of a banana chart)!  You can't argue with success.  You may ask, ""wait--the fixed segments of the 571 mean the banana chart will always be divided into 18 parts--what about other proportions?""  As mere laymen, you may not have heard: the Hutzler 571 inspired the American Association of Primate Colleges and Universities to adopt a standard mathematical base of 18.

But what really cinched it for me was how well it scrapes off those thick callouses I get on the bottom of my feet.  In just five minutes of scraping I have a pile of dead skin on the bottom of my kitchen floor.  The curved shape also makes it easy to scrape the skin shavings into the dustpan.  Such a  versatile  little thing.  And it slices bananas in a fraction of the time it takes to cut a whole banana!

4462,1722,1722,5.0,04 Jan 2013,"Years of slaving away in my laboratory, endless sketches, drawings, designs, countless failures and frustrations, all with one goal, my dream, my purpose in life and sole reason for existence!!! The quest to create the perfect banana slicer!!!  The fools around me all told me it couldn't be done, the FOOLs...they told me that only knives would ever be effective in slicing a banana, but I would not listen to them, NO, I was going to be the one who silenced them all, for I knew that there was another way! And finally, FINALLY after 30 long years hidden in my mother's basement toiling away on my invention, I had finally done it!!  I had developed a machine of pure beauty and power with the unmatched ability to slice a banana like no one had every seen before.  I called it the super-magnificator-eviscorator 3000.  A 372 ton machine that was created from parts taken from my 85 ford tempo, a Ouija board, hundreds of discarded furbees and a pair of my 1985 era parachute pants... With my machine, I was finally able to harness the energy generated by the thoughts of my 9,785 genetically altered monkeys that I had trained and engineered specifically for this purpose, transforming their banana loving mind-power into a fission powered laser that would sear a banana with 1,345 degree Fahrenheit rays, creating 17 perfectly sliced pieces of mouth-watering milk and cereal accompanying loveliness.  I would, of course, first have to capture, peel and strap the unsuspecting banana into position on the laboratory table beneath the machine, all while telling it how foolish it was to have underestimated me and to have walked into my diabolical trap.  But while these things took time, they were worth it, because I knew that once I had created this machine, once I had tasted my sweet success on my lips, I knew, KNEW that I could use my power to influence millions of healthy unsatisfying cereal eaters all over the world and eventually become a congressman, or maybe even, a speaker of the house!  I couldn't wait to put my plan of action into place and I was just about to take my place in evil genius history....until...until...until that dreaded day that I was searching for an apple peeler on Amazon and I came across this item and I realized that I had been confounded again, by the dastardly workings of my nemesis, my arch enemy and bane of my existence...the nefarious, and devious Mr. Hutzler...who created this, this...plastic...abomination....capable of slicing a banana into not 17, no, not 17 but 18 beautiful and symmetrical banana slices! My invention would only allow 17 pleasurable bites of wheaties to be eaten during breakfast, but his, his creation had the ability to create 18 bites of pleasurable wheaties eating enjoyment.  The shame I feel, the humiliation, no one will ever understand.  OH, I WILL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME MR. HUTZLER WITH YOUR SIMPLY NAMED HUTZLER 571.  I will accept defeat....for now....but one day, one day, I will develop an invention that will cut a banana into, wait for it....20 pieces of banana!  That's right, 20 pieces...you thought I would go with 19, but I am two steps ahead of you, and one day, I will have the banana slicer with a 5 star review!

I consider myself frugal, and, in this economy, I want to spend each penny very wisely. After extensive research, I realized that this was THE banana slicer that would make my life complete.  As a geeky computer nerd, I devised a plan and then began writing a ""worm program.""  This program was designed to infect the hosts' computers and propagate itself in such a way so that it loitered on hundreds of thousands of computers on the internet then notified me of when the perfect Hutzler 571 price occurred and identified that online merchant.  I managed this by friending thousands and thousands of people on a social media website that rhymes with ""mace look.""  All of those people played a game on that site.  The name of the game rhymed with ""alarm - hill.""  By interacting with me in ""alarm - hill,"" I was able to give their topsoil ""worms.""  They thought they would yield good crops from my ""worm"", my real goal was to get the best deal on a Hutzler 571.

No knives to be found anywhere in the asylum, only sporks. You see, my third personality is a cereal guy and likes sliced bananas on his chow. I tried using one of the triangular wedges in the star -- at the tip of the wand -- wielded by Frank, the alleged ""Good Witch of the North."" Unfortunately, these slices were aesthetically unpleasing. The guy in the corner playing checkers with his nose against an invisible partner had no suggestions. One day, after the Thorazine wore off and I had my weekly mineral oil enema, it struck me: Why not ask a staff member to look for a safe and effective way to slice bananas? Within 48 hours of trading sexual favors for assistance, I found myself holding the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. What a dream! The slices are like little yellow coins! With toothpicks, you can even make little feet out of them! My third personality will never suffer again!",Ryan

For example...I had some family over to the house and you know how much mom loves here sliced banana to go with her morning scotch. Anyway...all the knives were in the dishwasher and I thought she was going to really give me the business until I remembered I had the Hutzler 571! I wipped it out and sliced her banana into perfect portions and served it to her. She was amazed and savoured every bite. I never told her my secret and each time she visits I give her that special sliced banana she loves. I highly highly suggest that anyone who enjoys a great sliced banana buy this product..enjoy it, savour the flavour, make up for lost time, and really grab life and live it to the fullest.

I had been trying for months to replicate the delicate framework of a banana, but to no avail. My diagrams, flawed. My models, childish. I toiled over the material and the color for my models. I tried to use string to create them, but it didn't travel well. Next I tried rocks, but they were difficult to glue together and much too heavy to carry. Finally I settled on cheap plastic. Finally, I had my material! Cheap plastic would be light enough to carry and durable enough to ship. Now onto the color... I tried blue, white, black, pink. Nothing looked right. I couldn't figure it out. I had my diagram and I had my model. What was wrong? I just couldn't understand why it didn't look right. I had given up. As days turned into weeks, weeks to months, I began to become a recluse. After years of self loathing I came across the most peculiar thing. Whilst browsing the interwebs I had found my model! Only it wasn't MY model... it was the 571B Banana Slicer. 571B BANANA SLICER! Its dimensions, its configuration, its proportions all correct! It looked glorious. Oh so glorious! I began to weep. My model... finally it had a color that was so perfect it seemed godly. But how. How could my model have gotten into the wrong hands?! How could anyone have known about my research? Then it hit me... Mojo Jojo. He had been my old community college buddy and was the only one that could have know about my dream of creating anatomically correct fruit models. He must have gotten to my paperwork. He must have seen my blueprints! He is using my design in a convoluted plan to take over the world! PEOPLE, this is not a banana slicer! It is an anatomically correct banana model that is being falsely advertised to be used to slice bananas so that slowly our human hands will no longer know how it is to firmly grasp a weapon! Mojo Jojo is using my models to cause your hands to become soft! I beg you, pick up your knives! Learn how to wield one again! As I hope it's not too late...",Mrow

4501,1761,1761,2.0,29 Oct 2014,"I bought this product because of the high reviews not even knowing what it did, but I figured if everyone was rating it so well I had to have one.  First, mine didn't come with any directions.  After reading reviews and asking questions for 3 days I found out you needed a banana to use it.  Naturally my next question was ""what the hell is a banana and where do I get one?""  Well after 3 more days of asking on my favorite sewing website, I learned you can buy them at food stores, that bananas have nothing to do with sewing machines and that I'm evidently a jerk for not knowing everything.  I headed to my local Walmart and they were kind enough to guide me to the banana section.  I asked for the most beautiful banana they had and the clerk gave me a large bright yellow thing that was full of splendor.  I was so excited to try out my new banana and slicer that I ran home and left my car in the parking lot.  Three and a half hours later I got home and realized I probably would've actually got home faster in the car which will get me from Walmart to my house in 18 minutes.  Anyways I was bubbling with joy that I could finally use my Hutzler 571.  Well, I looked online and fortunately read some helpful reviews that told me I had to take what's called the banana peel off.  Thanks Amazon.  It took me two hours to find my box of razor blades and another 45 minutes to cut the peeling off, but I finally got it off and was ready to use my slicer.  It took another 20 minutes to figure out how the banana fit in the slicer, but I figured that out all by myself.  I sliced the banana in less than 2 seconds.  It was incredibly fast.  Now if only Hutzler would make a peeling machine and sell them as a set the world would be perfect.  This is when the problems started.  After sitting on my counter for a week the banana turned black.  I think this slicer is made of GMOs or something and destroyed the DNA in the banana.  I'm no sciencer, but the banana was a glorious yellow before using the slicer and now it's black and mushy.  You can't tell me that's just coincidence!  Don't use this product.  I was going to get another banana and try the process over again to verify that the banana turned black after using the slicer, but my car is still at Walmart.  I really need to get that back.",metzler

4506,1766,1766,4.0,05 Apr 2013,"A medium banana (118g) is about 105 calories with 14g from sugar. This product makes it simple to calculate precisely how many calories you consume. Let's say you've had a hard day and you're literally a Snickers bar from blowing your diet wide open. With each individual slice of the banana you know you're getting 5.83 calories per slice and 0.778g of sugar (minus the tips which due to their irregular shape should really just be fed to the dog). This level of detail and control over consumption dynamics is critical to maintaining the body's uniquely balanced levels, addressing everything from cell reproduction to the release of proper serotonin levels for mind-body optimization.

I received the same response as we dined afterward, at McFadden's.  I could tell how impressed they were by my dining companion!  When I was stopped by a policeman, in the diamond lane, he immediately let me go when he saw Hutzler 571 beside me in the passenger seat!

You wind up with three or four banana-length slices which are beautifully even, and you don't lose the reminiscent shape of your original banana (a real plus in my book).

I thought the slicer was to be grasped as one would a tomahawk and slammed downward in a motion to cut the banana without worrying about a sharp knife injury. I thought those small plastic bars traversing the machine were for strength. That explains two things: (First) using a hammer-like stroke still produces unequal slices and (Secondly) it was very disturbing to my family to hear me flailing away at the banana on the cutting board as they were trying to get some more sleep while I was preparing breakfast. Once I realized that the device was meant to be pressed into the banana, my foolishness became apparent, and I was embarrassed.

Exactly the same width with no smush, stringyness, or whatever.  (I know it's hard to believe, but it's true!)  Unfortunately, she passed away a few years ago, bless her soul, so if I was to have my morning cereal with banana slices, it was up to me to do the slicing.  I cannot describe the utter failure with which I met with by attempting this truly daunting task.  Not only were the slices of banana of extremely irregular, almost grotesque thickness and shape (not to mention how many were simply reduced to smoosh), the many trips to the emergency room for stitches were quite the bother.  Trust me, stitches are no fun.",Andrew R. Hesh

4588,1848,1848,5.0,05 Apr 2013,"The Hutzler 571-B Banana Slicer is a huge improvement over the 571-A and builds on the genius of such fruit-slicing giants in the Hutzler product catalog as the 565 and the now mythical 549. (Though personally I have a soft spot for the patina on the old tin 552 models, which can't be matched by today's polymer coatings). Where to start singing the praises of the 571-B? Well, let me say that it cuts crisp slices without too much mashing, and any banana maven worth their peel knows that is saying something. Slices were neat and square and uniform. That's important when you consider that an asymmetrical slice can ruin your whole day, not to mention that bowl of corned flakes. The action is similar to the 567 model from the '80s with a twist - if you apply even pressure, you get better results. It also goes without saying that the 571-B can outperform the latest slicer from",fruitbutcher

Banana-related injuries are even worse during the holidays, when folks try to show off their fancy breakfast skills for their families. The result is incalculable tragedy and stumpy limbs for all.

As you know, the depictions on the tomb walls are of ancient Egyptian funerary rituals and beliefs concerning the after-life.  Religious scholars have long marveled and debated the existence and significance of triads naturally occurring in nature, as well as religion, i.e. the Trinity of Christian-theism to the triad in ancient suzerainty treaties, i.e. history, law, and sanctions, etc.  The erasure we were looking at was basically this: ///x///x///x///x///x///.  While we were puzzling over the strange markings and wondering what they could mean, my colleague removed the 571 banana slicer from his pack to slice up a couple of bananas--we were shocked into silence--there were exactly 18 slots for the slices on the 571, meaning it possessed a perfect triadic configuration--3 groups of 6, which also equaled the number of lines in the erasure we were analyzing; 18 slices and 18 marks on the erasure.  We are uncertain of the connection, but we have petitioned for additional grants to fund future expeditions to resolve this conundrum.  Could the 571 be the key to unlocking the whole system of ancient Egyptian mythology? Could it be the key to time, space, the after-life, or even the Universe? Does it possess mystical powers, frequencies, or provide the ultimate balance sought in feng shui? Only additional grant monies can help us answer these questions.  Your purchse of the 571 will help us prove the importance of this work and secure the necessary endowments.  Thanks.",MetaTaPhysika

I had encountered a lot of trouble when I tried to cut them in the past. Bananas would roll off the chopping board, I would accidentally cut off a finger, or I would get so bored with the monotony after managing to cut 2 or 3 slices that I would simply lose my appetite. I was almost starting to think that I was part of a conspiracy and there was a bad banana element that had it in for me. When the ol' Hutz turned up, I was beside myself! Filled with anticipation I ripped the 571 out of the packaging and looked for the instructions.  There were none. I was flummoxed. How did I use it?? I got my first banana and managed to fit it inside the frame of the device. Then what? Your guess is as good as mine. I hurled it against the wall, but it did not produce any of the slices that had been so slickly advertised. I retrieved the device and next tried to shove a banana through just a part of the device, but there are a bunch of thin yellow strips that were too close together and it wouldn't fit. Finally, I reasoned that it had to be a specially-designed heavy duty safety knife, that by sheer coincidence was shaped like a banana. I gripped the banana tightly in one hand and laid the long edge against the banana to make the first of the 18 cuts. To my chagrin, the plastic was so thick that it just squished the banana. Each time I tried to cut another slice, the same thing happened. Who do these people think they are? This is blatant false advertising. I want my money back.

It's bad enough the Tupperware orange peeler got us our first baby. Then there was the pampered chef citrus juicer.  That got us twins.  Then came the juice master. No warning on that one, either.  We got baby four from that. We ended up adopting baby five after borrowing the neighbor's tuna juicer. We were sure that would be the worst of it. Nope!

I felt very wasteful throwing all those other bananas away. Then one day I bought a batch of bananas I knew were really too small to fit the curve of the slicer, but they were all my supermarket had.  The slicer cut them just fine!  That's when I realized that if I cut the wrong bending bananas in half, I could position them in the middle of the slicer, and it would cut them!  Since this discovery, I've used a knife to cut those bananas in half first, but I've also used a large spoon and even a fork one time.  I discarded the unevenly cut piece that resulted as well as the uneven end pieces.  Still, it was a lot less waste than throwing away all the wrong bending bananas.  My husband warned me that the tool was not meant to be used this way and that I might void the warranty, but I'm willing to take that risk.  I think this fix should be included in the instructions.

It seems every other customer has had some transcendent experience with this thing cutting their bananas perfectly.  I however have several gripes which cannot be overlooked.  First, the shape of the 571B.  I spend hours picking out bananas shaped in this exact fashion.  Keep an eye out at the grocery, you'll probably see a few people huddled together, rifling through banana bunches, pressing their 571B's against the skin, praying to find just one more match.  Also, the number of slices is just ludicrous.  18 banana slices is far too many. I personally can only eat about 10 at any given time.  And finally, the character of Mr. Hutzler is always in question, you know what I'm talking about.  I suggest the Slugworth banana slicer over this mediocre commodity any day.",Amazon Customer

Thanks to Hutzler, I can now more effectively defend myself against the dreaded Banana Fiend!  I was worried sick that I would be attacked by someone carrying a Banana, the most dangerous form of tropical fresh fruit.  Now you can neutralize the threat with 100% effectiveness and have a tasty snack at the same time.  You too can defend yourself in 4 easy steps.  Step one - Remove the Banana from the rapacious and villainous attacker.  Step two - peel the dreaded fruit.  Step three - apply the Hutzler Banana Slicer to the skinless Banana, thereby neutralizing the lethality of this dreaded killer.  Step four - eat the Banana as a tasty snack and to prevent the inevitable cramping after all of this activity.  Never leave your house afraid!  Own the night!

4627,1887,1887,4.0,23 Oct 2013,"Before discovering this product, my housemate and I had a terrible dilemma.  Every week we bought bananas, but struggled in vain to eat them.  They were far too heavy for us to lift all in one piece, and none of the magic incantations we used to slice them were working to an adequate level.  We only figured out how to peel them by accident when one of the bananas brushed against an industrial sanding machine.  The problem consumed our lives.",Madeleine
4628,1888,1888,5.0,04 Jan 2013,"I resent all these people mocking this ingenious slicer. I was born with a condition called adactyly and I only have one digit on each hand and no thumbs. It is extremely difficult for me to slice bananas since I can't hold a knife easily with only one finger. I usually go without sliced bananas because it is dangerous to hold a knife with my teeth and it's inconvenient to wash up my feet which are what I typically use for fine slicing, chopping, and mincing. With the Hutzler 571, I can easily slice bananas now by simply placing it on top of the banana and pressing on either end with my finger. This is a god-send.

Pressed for time I didn't want to have to wait for 3 different bowel movements so I used the handy Hutzler 571 on a log, and baddabing, badboom. All done in one shot! And the left over slices went down the bowl with ease and left no skid marks. A quick rinse in the sink and it was fresh and ready for bananas again.

You see, a couple of months back I had a blow up and lost my best friends because I had no idea that I was offending them by looking them in the eye while I was eating my bananas. So with a spring in my step, and a newly found conviction for bananas, I went immediately to the natural market and bought a bunch of bananas. But it turns out all those bananas were leaning to the right more than the engineers had figured a banana could, so I had to get out my knife anyway. That is when things got out of hand. I had banana slime on the cutting board, the knife, and my new Hutzler 571 B.  3 dirty banana dishes for what used to only take 1.

If you mistakenly use the Hutzler 571 upside down, your slices will be off-center and, in some cases, crooked.

I had not eaten for days remembering my last attempts at slicing the banana. I say ""the"" banana because to me it was the only one in existence. The way it taunted me, tearing at my soul. As if to laugh at me whispering that it had won. The experience makes me shudder even now. That banana had refused to let me slice it. It withheld my attempts as if my knife was made of merely tissue paper. It glistened it's yellowness back at me unscathed by my efforts. I had been defeated and was going down fast. The relentless banana smirked at me as I attempted repeatedly to cut even the smallest of slices. It was then in my dark kitchen that I retreated. If I couldn't slice a banana than what could I do? My depressing thoughts were swarming around me. They were pulling me down like a mudslide bringing me deeper into my depths of banana depression. I was a failure. I had hit rock bottom. I was alone with my perfect banana still sitting on the counter as a reminder of my abilities to accomplish absolutely nothing. It was then that in desperate moment that I turned to glowing computer googling for a remedy. If not for my situation than for the cease of my misery. I had come to terms with the fact that this might indeed be the end of my banana slicing days. Then I found a flicker of hope! Like a small ray of light streaming through a cave after being entrapped for days! Had I possibly found an answer to all of life's meaning in one simple click? Had I found the one rope that could bring me back? Yes I had, I had found the 571B Banana Slicer! And with it, a reason to go on slicing. I can't even explain the anticipation as I waited for this miracle 571B Banana Slicer to arrive in the mail. The hours I waited watching the mailbox. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat, but this time it was because of pure hope and anticipation. My 571B Banana Slicer finally came! I stood before the stubbornly perfect banana in my kitchen before I had even realized I'd opened the package. Holding the 571B Banana Slicer in my hand I took a deep breath and then sliced. It was more like a dream than reality. The banana retreated before my eyes falling into a perfectly sliced pile on the counter. I paused taking in the moment. I had won, banana's were worth slicing again. I was able to slice a banana with ease and the feeling elated me. If I could accomplish this than what else was out there for me to conquer? A Banana today, an orange tomorrow and possibly even a fruit salad someday?! Think of the possibilities! This product will change the world!!",DaRyZe

That said, I highly recommend that you go all out with this product and buy a new one, instead of buying the cheaper, $0.01, used product. First, it took three full weeks to ship the thing, even though it was being shipped from the same city and state I live and work. That in itself dampened my enthusiasm to have perfectly sliced bananas with my morning cereal, but then it arrived and, to my everlasting regret, I see now that my money-saving ways had not only cost me many banana-less mornings, but also, I was the proud owner of a USED (dull) banana slicer and that my neighbors had bought the new 571A banana slicer and not only did they receive theirs a full week earlier than I but I am now reduced to ducking under the cabinets as their Oh so spoiled children peer through my kitchen windows, pointing and laughing at what is very obviously a cheaper, less shiny version of their new best friend.

Some slices are too thin while others are so thick you feel like a squirrel stocking your cheeks for the winter. I gave up on corn flakes all together, even though I would often dream of that beautiful union from time to time. It felt as if something were missing, the light on the darkest days had extinguished, until two weeks ago. Hutzler 571 rekindled that light. I never imagined my breakfast could be this euphoric. It should be illegal to have this type of perfection! This product took my breath away, it is my 50 Shades...My 50 Shades of Hutzler.

Therefore, I knew EXACTLY who this joyous surprise was from, as I had posted on FB a link to this exact HERTZLER BANANA SLICER product page on Amazon's website and proclaimed it would make for a perfect gift. My prankster MOM had made an EXTRAORDINARY gift choice!!

And after the gift was unveiled to all family members, we were trying to take the perfect picture of our new HERTZLER BANANA SLICER, which of course required several hands, INCLUDING the driver of our vehicle. After the luminescent flash from the camera had dissipated, we THEN saw we had inadvertently veered to the side of the road and were only INCHES away from a truck parked in the street - we nearly had a head-on collision in our neighbor's yard! Thankfully, the Lord's angels were with us as my fabulous Husband quickly AND successfully pulled us back to safety, onto the road, and out of the path of what had appeared to be inevitable destruction!

I took a banana from the back of the toilet and began slicing in the dark, with a knife, while a prefectly good banana slicer was on the sink I couldn't see. There was that one incident in 1987 where I sliced from bottom up, but since then it's clear sailing using a knife. We all have those war stories about slicing at 3:00 AM, I enjoy sitting around a campfire talking with friends about banana slicing mis-haps, anyway.

When you're not looking, bam there they are right under your foot ready to break your neck, or your back.So you need to know where you stand with them all the time. The only way to know where to stand with someone is to look into their eyes, right? Normally bananas don't have eyes, potatoes do, but not bananas. So it's hard for me to trust them. Hence. The googly eyes. I use the 571 banana slicer and put googly eyes on all the slices so when the banana jumps on the floor I can see all those eyes looking up at me. Still, it's a good rule of thumb.

I eat a lot of oatmeal at work and having sliced bananas in my bowl is a must. Growing tired of using the plastic knives they give us in the lunchroom that don‚Äôt cut decently, I resorted to chopping up my banana by hand. The result was catastrophic. Imagine having mashed banana all over your hands while typing out a lawsuit deadline. The look on my keyboard would make anyone with a soul want to vomit. I really NEEDED my 11am bowl of oatmeal with banana or my road rage disease would morph me into Dr. Jekyll.  But my hands would be covered in mashed banana.

Knives were for rich people,  so the banana, for us poor people, had to be eaten whole. Yes, we made crude attempts at breaking it evenly, but we knew that this was not how it was meant to be. The rich kids would taunt us, 'Hey', they would shout, 'nice banana, did you break that with your hands, peasant?' Sometimes, after days like this, I would cry myself to sleep. We dined on wild berries and lentils, drank goats milk and made our own cheese. We passed our days dancing in the sand and making sand angels, they were wild carefree and happy days. My brother, Manuelo Johannen Santa Maria Cruz loved to make things. 'Come dance in the sand' we would call out to him, but he would sit under the banana tree, fashioning things from the bark, telling us, 'tomorrow, I will come with you tomorrow'. One day, after a particularly hot afternoon spent dancing in the sand dunes, we joined Manuelo and asked him what he was making. I will never forget that day. He had made a wooden device that could slice a banana. How we rejoiced, now I could answer those taunting rich kids, I could show them my sliced banana. Life was good.",FLORA

4727,1987,1987,2.0,21 Jan 2013,"After reading almost 1000 reviews about the Hutzler 571 banana slicer, I was still on the fence. I felt that ever though my slices were not uniform, How could I turn away from my faithful chainsaw for my fruit cutting needs? I soul searched, trekked to the himalayas for answers to my deepest question ""What if my bananas do not accept this form of slicing?"" And then I found resolution in the fact that my waffles just might find acceptance in using bananas upon them. I ordered with gusto! But no one tells you about the terrible secret. Once my product arrived I went to my bunker to the banana storage area and grabbed as many as I could carry. With great care I sidestepped all concerns (peeled said bananas, made sure all of my bananas were in fact right handed models, et cetera et al) of prior reviewers and spent hours uniformly slicing my fruit. I must have fallen asleep after hours of bananing. I woke and begun preparations for a fruit salad WHICH INCLUDED EVENLY SLICED BANANAS. But I could not find my Hutzler 571 banana slicer anywhere. I looked everywhere! I was heartbroken. I knew I would never be the same until I could slice bananas, and at this point the chainsaw just would not do once I had known the joys of a hutzler sliced perfection. I had to get back on the internet and order them, in bulk if needed. I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands, knowing that if I got any of the bananas on my keyboard it might cause erroneous information to be sent to amazon, keeping me from my sliced yellow goodness. I lathered, then looked up, and then to my horror; I saw it. On the glass, written in smashed pale goo were the words ""Welcome to the world of bananAIDS-Hutzler"" Now my Potassium (P-cell) count has dropped to nil, I have yellow crescent sores all over my body, and every time I have sex make banana pudding when climaxing.

When that's the case, you might as well just throw the damn thing away (the banana, not the slicer). And then the opposite problem could be true. If the banana is smaller than the size of the slicer, how do I know which way to position it? Do I try to fit it in to the flat end, or the end that curves? Or do I try to position it exactly in the middle and avoid touching the edges, like a game of Operation? What if the banana I'm slicing curves at too much of an arc for the slicer to contain?",Todd

It's not a dexterity problem, but some kind of mental block.  It might have something to do with the sheer brutality of slicing a vulnerable-looking banana off at the tip, which speaks well to her sense of mercy, if not to her kitchen skills.  But that was before the Hutzler 571 entered our lives.  Now banana slicing has become one of her favorite activities.  While re-reading ""Breaking Dawn,"" Mavis will idly slice a banana every few pages, and mold the resultant slices into tiny golden-hued statuettes of Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, and Kristen Stewart.

Getting her to up to the elevated platform in her cage, which is traditionally and properly where one places a gerbil's food and water in spite of any difficulty it may pose for impaired animals, has been something of a recurring chore with normal ramps or ladders. She starts off pretty well at the bottom and is able to more or less navigate in a straight line by starting at the far left side of the base and compensating for the shorter leg by underextending the normal one. Problem is that as she goes further up, she looks down at how high off the ground she is, starts to panic and forgets to adjust for the leg. Time and time again she would get SO CLOSE to the top only to tumble off the far side of the ladder/ramp during the last two steps, bouncing into the wood chips below and requiring pep talks to get started again.

I have tried to slice a regular sized and shaped banana, but this piece of crap doesn't even fit! The banana sticks out on both ends, while most of the slicer sticks out the same way above the banana. I was only able to obtain like 2-3 slices from the middle section of the banana, but both ends of the banana remain unsliced for the most part. It's like they deliberately tried to make it NOT fit the shape of a banana. Any sane designer/engineer would have constructed the slicer in a way that the main component is 90 degrees from where it is right now, which I guess might actually make the slicer fit the banana, but the way it is assembled now the design is just completely flawed! :-(",john_wiedenhoeft

He is an accountant and the accumulative cost of supporting my habit of buying bananas, eating a choice few then leaving one or two to  shrivel and blacken in the fruit bowl was too much for him. I'm fond of bananas and couldn't promise not to spend in this area again. I tried exchanging our dog for one that eats bananas on their way out but my husband was suspicious and checked the bins for tell tale skins. I was just packing my bags and wishing the children all the best for their lives when the post arrived. Who'd have thought my old school friend Lesley Whittle could be of any use to me...she'd sent me a Hutzler banana slicer. I live in America and she is in England. I rarely give her a second thought ..and now she has saved my marriage. Slicing bananas with this delightful implement is such fun we have eradicated the problem with old bananas in the fruit bowl. Now our entire family gathers together in a group hug to celebrate the joy and handy hilarity of Hutzler slicing action in the supermarket parking lot and all the bananas are eaten before we get home.

4855,2115,2115,5.0,12 Oct 2013,"At work, mostly I just slice meat all day. It's a good enough job, except your arm gets tired sometimes, and of course when you walk around outside you always smell like rotten meat, which is weird to some people, people who don't slice meat. Sometimes I get to put the slices of meat in the case, and that's my favorite part. Mr. Jenson, he's the head of the meat department, he says I have some of the best meat slice cases he's ever seen, and he should know, because he stares at meat all day. One time around Christmas I made a nativity scene of meat, and if I remember right the three wisemen were slices of three different kinds of smoked turkey, and the baby Jesus was a pile of ground beef, because by the time I got to him I didn't have any more meat slices just the ground stuff. When I come home I don't want to slice meat any more, I just want to slice fruits and things, because I think you should keep work and home separate. And at home I can't slice bananas with my meat cutter because the meat cutter has a lot of blood on it, and also because it's not at my home it's at work. So the slicer here does the trick. Since with the slicer all the slices of the banana look the same, I can make scenes from the Bible with the slices really easy, scenes like when Jesus was born, and also when he died, and also when he was walking around doing things between being born and being dead. I give the slicer 5 stars because it makes the making of the scenes a lot better and easier than if I was to try to use a meat slicer that I don't have.",Arthur Laraby

I am beside myself because of course since already using the slicer twice I will not be able to return it and get the newest model. I am told that the new model will be in a green banana color and cut smaller slices which are now the new code. Also the new slicer will have much more privacy features so the NSA cannot track its use. The one I did get however is allowed on airlines.  I was allowed to bring it on the plane in my purse so it was handy my entire flight to Rome.

Or, lacking this, could someone direct me to a local clinic or workshop where the proper technique could be mastered in a safe and supportive environment? At the very least, could Hutzler develop an app for the iPhone, so when temptation calls, I could review pertinent ""tips and tricks"" and use the 571 as its creator intended? With these small improvements, I believe the 571 would earn a treasured spot in any modern kitchen.",J. F. Shanley

I was a normal boring Saturday afternoon sitting by the pool when two of my neighbors came by to say ""hello"".  I had a bunch of bananas proudly displayed on my custom made Game of Thrones banana throne.  I used real knives so you can cut the top portion of the banana for more efficient peeling.  This enticing display of bananas was too much for my neighbors and they both went for the Hutzler 571 Banana at the same time.  Unable to wait for the other person to utilize the Hutlzer 571, the two neighbors picked up the closest thing they could find to use as a weapon.  It was glorious and horrible at the same time to see the two neighbors battling with two pool noodles, stabbing and thumping each other in front of the Iron Throne.  I had to call the Sheriff to separate them, what an awful experience.  The image of my two neighbors being hauled off in handcuffs in their swimsuits, covered with rug-burn rashes from the brutal fight.  All of this could have been avoided if Hutzler would sell these in two packs.  I see no other solution to this dilemma.",what do I type here
4895,2155,2155,5.0,31 Dec 2012,Finally after years of searching I can put away the oversized box fan I've been using to slice my bananas!  It was always a challenge to catch the bananas as they were sliced and the time it took to pick off the fuzz from the fan blades was frustrating. Not to mention all of the slices that were not uniform therefore having to trim some and glue the extra banana pieces on to the smaller pieces.  My husband is also excited to go back to just cutting apples with the Sawzall as the bananas tended to leave a sticky gooey residue behind.  My daughter's sad attempts to slice bananas with the weedeater have also been resolved.  I look forward to hearing from my family (who all got this product for Christmas) how this product has changed their lives also.  I had to order the 571c for my son who is left handed since we ordered the right handed version.  He can't wait for it to arrive so he can quit using the egg slicer which only cuts the bananas long ways....and tends to be rather challenging to keep the banana standing while he cuts it.,Mom2threeaz

When I was cutting the banana, the last piece would not push through! As I pushed and pushed it suddenly went flying straight into my father's eyes. We took him to the hospital and he was diagnosed with permanent blindness for the rest of his life. You see, my father's occupation is a pilot. So he lost his job. The rest of the unfortunate events followed with us losing our house and everything we own. We currently live in a cardboard box near Walmart.",Isabel

Whether it's a knife or an insipid plastic take-off on the hard-boiled egg slicer, the bottom line is that it is all violence.  Violence against our fellow planetary residents.  Besides, I'm sure this slicer is made from some sort of plastic, and plastic is a petroleum product.  You know where petroleum comes from, don't you?  It comes from Big Oil.  The selfsame criminals who are destroying our planet with carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide that banana plants and all other plants use as food to convert into oxygen and produce bananas for you to murder with slicers.  Oh, it all makes me sick.",Tripp Hazzard

I have longed to top my cereal and pancakes with sliced bananas.  I ordered two slicers in order to fulfill this life-long dream.  Imagine my excitement when they arrived!  I had to tear into the package with my teeth when I couldn't find my plastic scissors.  When I saw them, I realized they were just too attractive for utilitarian usage.  I converted mine into a pair of earrings.  They are fabulous!  I can hang my house and car keys on them.  I now save all of my receipts by rolling them up and sticking them in my banana skeletons.

Who would have thought that those tiny motions that come from spreading butter on corn, using toilet paper, and slicing bananas were so necessary to keeping my arms in fit human condition? They just hang there now, shriveled and atrophied, ruining my chances at becoming a Guitar Hero or ever being able to slice something as tough as a banana, hard-boiled egg, or tomato again.

4989,2249,2249,5.0,02 Feb 2013,"The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is a marked improvement over it's predecessor, the Hutzler 570.  The previous version of the banana slicer had some serious flaws which have been markedly improved upon.  First, it is important to note that the 571 has far superior fuel efficiency compared to the 570, thus making it more economically viable to the less wealthy consumer.  Furthermore, the pesky ""spontaneous ignition"" issue which plagued the 570 Banana Slicer has been almost completely eliminated.  While the new design makes the slicer look more like a natural banana, increasing the aesthetic appeal, it is now much easier to mistake the Hutzler 571 for an actual banana instead of a banana slicer, with potentially serious repercussions.  I've already lost 11 teeth trying to bite into this thinking it's my breakfast.  My newfound lack of teeth makes eating solid food difficult, but thankfully i have a product capable of slicing soft, delicious, bananas into managable pieces for my mangled mouth.  It's a product that becomes more and more useful as you use it more, and thus lose more teeth.  The epitome of appreciating value, I highly recommend this product.",Jeff L
