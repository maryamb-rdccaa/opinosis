0,5.0 ,24 Aug 2012,"Someone has answered my gentle prayers and FINALLY designed a pen that I can use all month long! I use it when I'm swimming, riding a horse, walking on the beach and doing yoga. It's comfortable, leak-proof, non-slip and it makes me feel so feminine and pretty! Since I've begun using these pens, men have found me more attractive and approchable. It has given me soft skin and manageable hair and it has really given me the self-esteem I needed to start a book club and flirt with the bag-boy at my local market. My drawings of kittens and ponies have improved, and now that I'm writing my last name hyphenated with the Robert Pattinson's last name, I really believe he may some day marry me! I'm positively giddy. Those smart men in marketing have come up with a pen that my lady parts can really identify with.",Tracy Bartell

11,5.0 ,25 Dec 2013,"My wife has struggled with man pens all her life. Try as she might, they always wrestle her down and she has to surrender using them, unless writing on a notepad for her macho employer. We have been hoping she could take over keeping the checkbook (PLEASE! No laughter! She is very capable of writing what I tell her in the ledger.) With Bic for Her, she now has the confidence, and proper fit, in her ball pen to write and do the things a woman should. Just yesterday, with her bridge club meeting, ALL the girls could keep score since she loaned them each one of the pens. The women all told her they felt so empowered, that they would serve dinner FIVE MINUTES LATE!!! My wife's best friend, Betty Sue, even insists her husband will have to tuck his OWN napkin in tonight.",David B
12,3.0 ,31 Dec 2012,"Can these pens be bought individually?  I only intend to write things until I find a man and get married, so it's a waste of my hard-earned secretary salary to buy the whole pack.",Ersil

14,2.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"I can only in good conscience give this product 2 stars until they offer an option for heavy flow days.  I mean, these are great for the last 2-3 days of writing, when the flow is pretty light.

18,5.0 ,31 Dec 2012,"Bought this for several ladies at the office to show my appreciation for their feminine qualities.

21,5.0 ,02 Sep 2012,"My wife and I have been married for ten years, and I admit, I had no idea how to mark this milestone.  What can you get your soul mate that shows her how much you love her and how much better your life is because she is in it?  These pens!  I used to watch the consternation that would consume my wife as she'd try to write invitations to her Sex and the City marathons or as she'd struggle to sign the bar bill (my liberated little lady likes to go Dutch)on her $9 cosmos; I could almost hear her thoughts, should I dot my I's with a smiley face? or a heart? and I'd think, ""if only there were a pen made for the complex, dainty, modern woman in my life to help her through these difficult times,"" and now there is.",Brian Dougherty

""How do I hold it?"" you wonder. ""What do I write on?"", ""What is math?"" I hear you, girlfriend. Let's face it, using your husband's pen feels like wearing trousers when not on a bicycle or horseback--it's just wrong!

Before, we were hardly able to get any work done, because those bulky, dark and dreary pens were depressing us.  You know how women get!

33,4.0 ,28 Nov 2013,"These are so great. Not only can I write recipes and outfit ideas with absolute ease, they even let me know when I'm getting too ambitious. Like I started to write a letter to my representatives in congress about my unequal wage at work, but my pen quickly reminded me- I'm a woman! Silly me! My opinion won't matter to a congressMAN. Thanks bic, no other pen could silence my silly opinions the way yours does. Not to mention, gender inequality stings so much less in pastel pink.",Hannah B
34,5.0 ,07 May 2013,"I love these pens, they come in very subtle but girly colors and ever since I started using them, they are the only pens I like to use, and I reorder every time I am out. I don't see them in the stores that often, but I can always find them here on Amazon ;-)",Cityy's Best
35,3.0 ,03 Oct 2014,With three gals in my house you can imagine how many of these I go through.  But now imagine my surprise when I saw that they were 10 dollars!

36,1.0 ,09 Dec 2014,"What do I even do with these ""pens?"" They're useless for spreading mayonnaise on my husband's sandwiches, they're not absorbent enough for my flow, and they're no good for painting my nails.

37,1.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"i used one of these pens by mistake, thinking i was reaching for my ""BIC Xtreme Pagemaster 9000"". i was only going to write a quick note to the wife and leave it on the fridge but what followed was the most sensitive, heartfelt letter to my dead gerbil (whom i hadn't thought of in thirty years) that i could have imagined. unending torrents of emotion poured out of me, and when it stopped i was in a ball on the kitchen floor, crying my eyes out. there's no way a man should be allowed around these pens. we're just not wired to withstand all those...feelings.",banana fan

39,3.0 ,29 Nov 2013,"I gave these to my wife as a gift and she said they wouldn't work at first.  I said, ""Silly, you're in your office.  Go to the kitchen.""  She did and they started to draw out a bit of ink, but the lines were still sketchy.  I said, ""Well, you still have your shoes on.  Take them off.""  She did, and once she was barefoot AND in the kitchen, these ballpoint beauties worked for her like a charm.  These pens obviously know their place.",Thomas J. Housworth
40,4.0 ,09 May 2013,"I was drawn in by the light crystal pastel colors, they're almost mesmerizing online but even more so in person.  What I appreciate most is the ultra lightweight feel of this pen in my hand, especially during that time of the month when you almost can't be bothered to get out of bed in the morning.  You know what I'm talking about, those days where you look and feel as though you've given up on life....sweatpants, chocolate, Ibuprofren and a sloppy pony tail. Who wants to be burdened with carrying around a bulky, high-quality pen made by a widely recognized and admired, reputable company? It's not like you're trying to impress anyone at this point. Why not free up some space in your purse since you'll be carrying around unmentionables to deal with private lady business?",Fleur de Lisa

43,5.0 ,11 Nov 2012,"I must admit that when I pulled these out of the package, I tested them out by writing a shopping list for a bake sale that I was working on. That's irrelevant though, as I would have done that anyway, BIC Cristal for Her or no BIC Cristal for Her, since that is something I do. The idea of pens made specifically for women is not necessarily a foreign idea to me, but many pens that are made specifically for women seem to be sold as alternatives, not as a replacement if you see what I mean. The way these are sold makes me feel that I must, for now on, only purchase pens made for women as I am not good enough to use regular pens. The other pens that I have, that were marketed to women, made me feel that I was born with a privilege of owning these special pens while also knowing that I could use any other pen I wished. It was an empowering feeling of knowing that I had additional choices. That aside, as a product, I really like these pens. They are slimmer than the regular BIC Cristal and come in prettier colors. There are faceted indentations on the end of these pens that catch the light, and the printing on the body of these pens is in silver foil. As someone with smaller hands, I find these more comfortable for me to use than the regular BIC Cristal. That said, my one gripe is that these pens only come with black or blue ink. I don't usually use regular black and blue ink, I often use pink, purple, turquoise, and green for my general writing. Personally, I think it would be a good idea to offer these in more colors in addition to the regular black and blue. As far as writing goes, these write the same way as any other BIC ballpoint I have written with. I think they are a bit smoother to write with than the BIC ballpoints of my childhood, don't blob as much, and don't require as much pressure. The ink still has the characteristic smell that I remember from BIC ballpoints from my childhood. That said, I think I'm sticking with my fountain pens, many of which are far girlier than these pens and can write with any color I so choose, like pink, purple, turquoise, sea foam green, spring green, mulberry and other fanciful colors that I currently enjoy.",Cupcakebunny
44,1.0 ,16 Sep 2013,"Normally I only use pens designed and created for real men, in colours appropriate to such instruments of masculinity - black like my chest hair or blue like the steely glint of my eyes, or the metallic paintwork of my convertible Mustang sports car. Imagine then the situation I found myself in when, upon taking delivery of another shipment of motorbike parts and footballs, I reached for and grasped not my normal BIC pen, but a `BIC for Her Amber Medium Ballpoint Pen' (evidently ordered by my well-meaning, but ill-informed girlfriend whilst my back was turned). I knew something was wrong when I had to physically restrain my hands, gnarled and worn from a lifetime of rock-climbing and shark wrestling, from crushing the fragile implement like a Faberge egg. Things only went downhill from there.",Chunky Le Funga

46,5.0 ,28 Nov 2013,"I recently purchased these for my wife as a novelty item, knowing full well that most women do not know how to read and therefore have very little use for a pen specifically for ladies.  Much to my surprise, she picked it up very quickly and within a few short hours was able to draw simple shapes and was starting to make letters.  While this was somewhat amusing, I had to take them away before she learned to spell, add, and sign her name, as this is not behavior that is acceptable for a woman.  Buyers beware!  While this product makes a great gag gift, it must by used under proper supervision.  The last thing you want is for a simple joke to turn into a tragedy. This product ranks right up there  with The Man's Cookbook.  What is this world coming to?",PapaJohn

49,3.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"Before I buy this product, I have a few questions I hope that some of you can answer for me. First and foremost, can I buy it online? If so, does it come in a discreet packaging that my mail carrier will not recognize as a ""feminine aid""? I attempted to purchase it from my local grocer but he refused, saying that an aged spinster such as myself has no place putting on such fine airs, and threatened to put me in my place should I ever ask for such inappropriate goods again.",Shanon Darling
50,4.0 ,13 Apr 2013,"I usually avoid any kind of writing, but when I'm out spending my husband's money, I've found a few places that still make you sign a paper slip for credit card purchases.  Thanks to BIC Cristal for Her, I now have cute pens that coordinate with my outfit!  The only downside is, that while the slender pen does fit my woman's hand, it is so skinny that I worry about looking fat in comparison.",Wren
51,5.0 ,09 Nov 2014,"What a bargain! On Amazon, BIC charges $6.79 for a 24 pack of regular BIC Crystal Bold pens, but only $10.14 for this 16 pack of BIC Cristal For Her pens.

52,5.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"Now that there is a pen for us, does it mean it's legal for ladies to write? Is that really a good idea?

53,5.0 ,28 Nov 2013,"A couple months ago, our family was on the brink of falling apart. But then my dad bought my mom ""BIC Cristal For Her"" pens for her birthday. Ever since my mom started using BIC Cristal For Her pens to write her grocery lists, our whole family has been saved! She now always has a nice cold Budweiser waiting for my dad when he comes home exhausted from his hard day of providing for us. No longer does she forget to buy my sister the ingredients she needs for her bake sales so she can raise money for her dowry.

56,5.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"I am not ashamed to say as a man I also use these. I do so consensually and in the privacy of my own home and am harming nobody in doing so. The liberated feeling of using a Bic pen created for a lady is nothing to be ashamed of, people used to look down upon a man using two different ink colours and we changed that, why shouldn't we change attitudes towards pens too?

58,5.0 ,01 Mar 2013,"I was young and impertinent, as I arched a brow at the package in my hand. BIC Cristal For Her? I scoffed and haughtily tossed my raven hair over my shoulder, sending it cascading down my back. I threw down the package and reached for the strong and thick man-pen which had always satisfied me. It's girth reassured me that IT was in control, and I gave myself over to my passion. I hardly knew myself as I boldly uncapped it's man-hood sheath with my mouth, holding it firmly in my teeth. As I fondled the throbbing spear of plastic, my page was filled with the hot, wet ink of its love. But alas, its arousal was too great, and spewed ink in a rage, covering my quivering mounds. Shocked and hurt at this betrayal, I vowed never to hold a turgid man-shaft pen in my hands again. Somewhat humbled, I picked up the BIC Cristal For Her package and delicately eased a slender, pastel pen from its hot sleeve of love. The silken warmth of  its body against my fingers sent delightful shivers up my arm and down to my secret nest of desire. We have been together happily ever since.",Howlin Walker

61,5.0 ,28 Nov 2013,"Let me tell you, I can't tell you how bad it is watching women struggle with man-pens.  They just can't seem to operate them, they're intimidated by the somber colors of blue and black and occasionally white, and then the pens just never seem, well, ""girly"" enough.  Finally, with a safe, pastel color and assurances from an impersonal company marketing exec that these pens are ""for her,"" I feel like I can finally give the women in my life a pen which they can handle comfortably and not feel like a man when they use it.  They even spell Cristal incorrectly, just so that special woman you give these pens to can draw a little heart over the letter i and cute-up that sterile, hyper-masculine package they come in.  Of course, I'd never allow a -man- to use one of these.  Goodness, one touch of the pastel pen and it's off to emasculation city!",Carlos Caro

When I was cleaning his room the other day I found these bic pens under his mattress along with fake eyelashes and ladies' underwear.. I talked to him and he opened up and came out to me.

The practice of law, particularly complex litigation, has been and in many places in the United States continues to be a profession dominated by men.

65,5.0 ,30 Apr 2013,"It's the year 2013, and I still have cause to be shocked at the level of male favoritism in every imaginable walk of life. They've long strutted around the office with their crude, phallic, utilitarian pens like they own the place--and what is the woman's option? To make a spectacle of herself by wrapping her hand around one of these chauvinistic, male-designed pens, forced to hang her head in shame amid the smirks and snickers of her male co-workers as she signs an employee birthday card?

68,5.0 ,26 Apr 2013,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! For the past 20 years I've been in a loveless and mentally abusive marriage.  All because of ink pens!  With no women's pens out there for me to write with I've been unable to provide a signature for a checking account of my own, apply for a credit card, and sign my name for a license to drive, among hundreds of other things.  Every month when the bills are due I watch my husband write out the check signing his name with a smile of utter satisfaction on his face.  When I beg to be allowed use of his ""man-pen"" he laughs at me taunting saying, ""you want to use my pen? too bad you're just a woman"" or ""what? you want to touch this (as he holds his pen close to my face just out of reach)?  Never!"" and then he laughs and laughs and points at me while I sit there crying.  Oh how I've waited for the day I could hold my own pen in his face and say:  ""NOW who's in charge, Buster?!""  As soon as I get my driver's license I'm driving to the bank, writing myself a check for all the money in the bank, opening my own account, then going to a divorce attorney's office and signing on the proverbial dotted line....with MY OWN ""JUST FOR HER"" PEN!

73,3.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"I was so glad when I found out about this pen! Regular-sized pens were so unwieldy with my frail, womanly hands that I had almost given up hope of writing my novel. But since I've started using BIC Cristal For Her pens, I've come to realize so many truths about womanhood! Forget about writing a silly old book. I now see that my place is in the kitchen, and with these pens, writing my grocery list is a piece of cake! Now, I wear kitten heels and pearls while I clean the house. Aside from these wardrobe upgrades, I FEEL so much more feminine! Plus, I love yogurt now, and I never did before! I know it's not a woman's place to offer suggestions, but if you guys added a spoon attachment to these pens, it would be the greatest thing since sliced bread (which, incidentally, comes in much more handy now that I make my boyfriend so many sandwiches)!",momeraths

I cannot tell you how many times that I have tried to write a check for groceries only to be embarrassed that I couldn't operate the pen given to me by the cashier. I have tried to remember to bring my own pen but sometimes I forget. If it is a female cashier, we just stare blankly at each other. It is so embarrassing to have to leave the store empty-handed. If I could remember a 4-digit PIN, I would use a debit card but as a woman, this simply isn't an option. I will admit that removing the cap was complicated at first. Then my husband told me to think of it as a lipstick or a cleaning product bottle and WOW! It was so easy! I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with complicated Man Pens.",Nicole Scott Smith

They are perfect for writing down recipes while I cook, clean and take care of our seven children. My favorite aspect is that I don't have to push so hard on them, considering my frail, weak lady-like hands. Don't get me started on the color coordination. Each one matches my dresses and skirts. I've even bought nail polish to match. These pens are perfect for all women around, and they encourage us to look slim for our husbands, based on their slim design. I absolutely cannot get enough of these. I hope Bic can create similar cooking-wear and even ingredient cards.",Stephanie Robertson

By this I don't mean dressing in pastel colors and causing me to suddenly start drawing unicorns and dotting my I's all funny. A 1.0 mm point?  What's the point?

I was followed into the restroom by a couple of my coworkers, something did not feel right. I did notice that I was now able to write in cursive, I actually tucked my shirt in, my hair looked amazing, but for some reason my driving skills were terrible. After work I went to the local dive bar, I did not thirst for my usual Coors Lite, I craved mixed drinks with little umbrellas. I never had to pay for one drink, everyone was so nice. When I arrived home, I emptied my pockets and all these phone numbers fell on the floor, my wife then accused me of cheating and being some kind of fruitcake!

So I grabbed a pen out of the drawer, boy I should have looked before I grabbed.  After inserting the pen in my breast pocket I started off to work.  As I was driving Celine Dion came on I started to cry.  I shook this off as maybe being from lack of sleep.  Later on at work I was in the break room making sandwiches for all the guys!  I was so confused, somehow I knew how to make any sandwich asked of me!  After I ate I felt bloated, I got terrible cramps in my lower abdomen for no apparent reason.  I took some motrin and chugged on.  Afterwards I felt the need to share my feeling with a fellow co-worker, who stared blankly at me as I explained my emotions.  It was like I was a different person, I get home that night to my wife completely naked but I had a rough day at work and had a terrible headache.  When it dawned on me that I had bought her these pens for her office job!  Immediately I took the pen out of my pocket and threw it away from me.  Instantly I felt like myself again, I told her to go make me a sandwich and all was right in the world again.

Being a statistician, I have to work through a lot of math in order to successfully build and apply statistical models for use by my employer. As a part of the brainstorming process, I find it helpful to write out equations to get an idea of how my model will function before I program it in the computer and actually estimate it with real data.  In order to work out these equations on actual paper products, I require an implement with which I can write. Accidentally, I ordered these pens. Beginning to work out my first equation with this new pen, I found that I couldn't even write out the standard notation for a function, f(x). Next I tried to write a summation symbol, a capital sigma. I got it out, but it was clear that this sigma was that of a sorority house name, NOT the summation symbol that I intended. After a few more hours of work, I looked back at what I had done, and found that rather than the equations I had thought I had written, all that appeared upon the virgin, white page was my signature written over and over again, but with the last names of various male celebrities, rather than my own! In fact, this pen had COMPLETELY DESTROYED MY ABILITY TO DO MATH! This pen was so effective, that I didn't regain my full skill set for at least 2 days after using it! Hats off to BIC for making a product that clearly works as intended. While it definitely does what it's supposed to do, it's unfortunately just not the right product for me thus meriting a score of four stars out of five.",SunDevil

So when I discovered that they in fact exist, I immediately bought a case in bulk. Of course I had to go behind my husband's back to acquire these.  When they arrived at my front door, I was so thrilled! But after a week or so of using this product, I don't understand it. Maybe I'm not using them right, but they don't make a good lipstick, they don't work as hair pins, they certainly don't make good tools for unclogging the vacuum, and when I tried to use them to tighten my corset, they broke!

142,3.0 ,28 Nov 2013,"These pens have destroyed my family! At first I was over the moon with finally finding a pen to fit my girlish pinkies. I could finally express my inermost thoughts and began writing childrens books about Princesses being rescued by handsome princes and living happily ever after. I could even dye my hair and write a diary/journal like all the pretty brunettes in vampire romance films. (Myself previously to your life changing writing sticks being a illiterate redhead) Life was wonderful, my daughter even gave up her silly notions of becoming an environmental scientist or even hahaha a police-man!!! and is now penning a corresepondence course in home economics and taking a degree in cup cake making. Life was perfect, we were so non threatening snd contemt with our lot. Then it hapoened...Prior to your pens I am ashamed to afmit it but my oartner and I lived in sin, but after using your pens I was so insecure about whether he would still love me when I lost my looks or gained more than 3 pounds and then leave me for a younger, thinner woman. I insisted I tale out a loan using my house for collateral and have a white church wedding (I am an atheist but I wanted the photographs to look traditional) with an enormous reception with lots of balloons and decked in swags of pink with lots of flowers. My daughter even designed our giant cupcake style wedding cake and looked so pretty in her pink dress as maid if honour. Only now do I see the depth of that gracious title and see how that ¬£3000 white dress made me feel so sexy and yet virginal all at the same time. (Despite being quite a nymphomaniac in reality) I even hired a man to pose as my father and 'give me away.' and found a jolly chimney sweep for good luck. No sooner as I had the ring on my finger telling the world I was no longer free but belonged to my man that things went from bad to worse! Before all our family to the strains of 'you are the wind beneath my wings' we went to dign the wedding register. I insisted that we use my pink Cristil pen, it had made me so happy and made the day possible. I signed first being 'a lady ' then my husband went to sign. As he picked up the pen, his rugged good looks fell away, his skin looked amazing and his hair fell in soft gentle waves. He looked into the distance wistfully and then at my brother, who came out recently after years of denial after a gift of your wondrous pens. (He cannot use them properly of course having large sized mannish hands but he is still grateful to be liberated at last) Some secret seemed to pass between them in a long gaze. My husband blushed girlishly and burst into tears saying he could not 'live a lie' and ran from the church hand in hand with my brother Tarquin!!! They took off in his new smartcar with the bumper sticker 'powered by fairydust' and havn't been seen since. I am now a single oarent. I am living on the street as I have lost my house to the bank as the wedding was never finalised so I was liable for all the debt of the wedding and of course resigned from my job to become a happy comtent housewife. My daughter has becone addicted to chocolate through stress and increased hormones and is now turning tricks for Galaxy Caramel and selling erotic cupcakes to fund her next fix. I was doing reasonably well as my revived looks and increased cupsize gave me a regular clientel for my Big Issue sales but when my final pink pen ran out last wk I went into premature menopause, flipped out and got a bit stabby with it! I sm now in a women's prison and am Big Charlie's bitch! (I think her pudgy paws have never caressed a real woman's oen in her life) I tried to write to my daughter but could not obviously as they only supply black or ovcasional blue 'men sized' pens. Life is hellish here. I had a postcard last wk from my brother in Accapulco but that only nafe things worse. Customers should be warned of the dangers of using these pens and your company should be more respinsible in the oackaging details. They should come with adaquate warnings I feel so women can make a thoughtful if not 'educated' desision in chosing them. I must apologise for my awful spelling in this review.

159,4.0 ,12 Apr 2013,"These pens changed my life.  It all started when I found them in my wife's desk one day and needed to jot down my current maximum bench press weight.  I picked up the firm pen, and it felt like no other pen before.  I couldn't believe the sudden feelings of confusion.  I mean these were girly pens, not meant for me, yet using them came so naturally.  The gooey ink flowed freely onto the page, and I found myself in the throes of a writing ecstasy I never imagined existed.  I threw it back into the desk and slammed the drawer closed.  But, over the next few days I succumbed and returned to the pens.  It was a forbidden pen, a beautiful pen, and it opened my mind to the possibility that I wasn't who I thought I was.  I started using the pens regularly and in secret, sometimes hiding in the closet.  It wasn't until my wife discovered that some of her pens were low on ink that she began questioning me.  At first, I denied everything and scolded her for even suggesting I would engage in that kind of effeminate lifestyle.  Sure, I had used her powder-fresh deodorant on occasion when mine ran out, but I was still the same manly man she married.  Over time, though, it became harder and harder to deny it.  I had to be honest with myself and then with the world.  She and I are still friends now, close friends even.

161,1.0 ,13 Sep 2012,"My life was that of an ordinary man prior to ""BIC FOR HER"". My time was spent in the woods doing woody things. My closest companions were my dog & an axe. To my knowledge the only stores that existed sold guns, camouflage & bait. I did not wear shoes, only boots, and I did not understand the meaning of the word delicate. You can imagine my discomfort then, when upon sitting down in my leather Lazy Boy to fill out my hunting license, scotch in hand, I found my traditional #2 pencil was broken, and the only instrument within reach was the ""Bic for her"" which my wife used to write down recipes. A battle waged in my mind between the need for a manly writing implement and natural aversion to getting up from my comfy chair. After several hours of contemplation, my hands reached out and grasped the feminine contours of ""bic for her"". My hard and gnarled fingers struggled to grip the cool and smooth surface of the pen. Suddenly a warm feeling coursed through my body. My wife tells me the change in my demeanor was instant. I began to demonstrate tenderness and sensitivity to her feeling. Instead of wandering to her chest, my attention focused the words coming from her soft lips. I began to surf the internet searching for a decorative floor rug to replace the hide from a bear that I had wrestled with my own hands. The deer rack on the wall was taken down, an artistic sconce to take it's place. I began to wear clothes that flattered my figure and I was careful not to spill on them. No longer satisfied with the biceps and shoulders that come from tossing hale bales, I began to do Pilates in the hopes of strengthening and toning my core. The DVR began to record, not Survivorman as it had every week, but Jersey Shore. Instead of wasting my time sharpening my collection of knives, I would offer to take my wife clothes shopping. I no longer had a problem buying feminine hygiene products and lingerie. The flannel that had been my covering for so long was now uncomfortable and I longed for a higher thread count sheet. After my morning constitutional, I would use fabreze and I began to seriously contemplate the practicality of a mini-van. The more I tasted the sweet and gentle life that ""Bic for her"" brought the more I forgot about manly things and the more ""in touch"" with my feeling I became. Instead of football scores, I became more concerned with the players' safety. I yearned to cuddle and even wept after making love. A turning point came as I waited in a grocery store checkout line and began perusing through the tabloids. I nearly cried when I read of celebrity divorces and contemplated buying special sneakers so that I too could have Kim Kardashian's buttocks. This terrifying though jolted me from the womanliness that had become my reality. Abandoning my cart of lean cuisines, I dashed out of the store and made my way to Gandor Mountain. There in the smell of sweat, sawdust, and gun oil, I found true self. Rushing to the fishing department I plunged my hand into a barrel of moist earth and drew out a fist of wriggling worms. As the stench and mud swept over my body, I found relief in that I was once again a man. As I left to store to make my way to the forest, I did what I should have done at the beginning. I picked up a #2 pencil.",Yovela

I began my entry by converting the grams of magnesium chloride I had just weighed out into moles, but when I looked back at the calculations, it seems I had written ""Wanna have a pizza party?"" instead.  So, I scratched that and began instead to record the absorptivity of a nucleic acids solution that I was using, but upon close examination of the notebook, instead of the absorptivity, I had written ""Will we ever have enough clothes?"".  I blamed this on weariness and perhaps a bad cup of coffee, so I moved on to recording the exposure level from my monthly radiation badge report, which somehow ended up being recorded as ""I love shopping!"" Frustrated and ragged, I moved to the final task of calculating the percent yield of the reaction I just performed.  After a pause, I realized that I had instead written ""Math class is tough!""

My dear husband Cletus has always known about my fancy aspirations, but he assured me (and rightfully so!) that pens and pencils are tools for men; too big and bulky for a woman's dainty hands and furthermore, sharp and dangerous!  So, you can imagine my shock and surprise when I awoke on my birthday to find a gift waiting for me at the kitchen sink.  At first I shrieked, grabbed my broom, and jumped onto a chair.  I whacked at it several times until I accidentally woke Cletus up.  After he gave me some sedatives to calm me down, he explained that it was not an evil, rainbow colored sink rat, but rather a BIC Woman Pen! I was so excited, I nearly talked without raising my hand!  Cletus was such a dear, though.  He forgave me, and even helped me open the packaging.  Holding my pink woman pen made me feel so powerful, so alive!  I may never learn how to write words, but for now I am just happy to have such a beautiful, gender appropriate pen to doodle with.

257,4.0 ,17 Jan 2013,"I'm the father of three in a hectic, busy household.  As such, it's often hard for me to find a writing utensil when I need one (paying bills, leaving instructions for dinner, placing orders for lawnmower parts, etc.).  Recently, I was in such a position, and came across a pack of these pens that my little lady must have purchased during one of her many shopping excursions (women, right?).  Needless to say, I was skeptical, maybe even slightly outraged.  What would my neighbors think if they saw me writing with a pen designed for a lady?  Much like clothes and bicycles, it's okay for a woman to use a man's pen with permission, but not the other way around.  However, being in such dire need, I closed the blinds, locked the door, and began writing checks.  The first thing I noticed was how similar this ink was to a more masculine ink.  It applied and dried in a very efficient fashion, and was remarkable legible, despite my expectations.  The design of the pen was also a pleasant surprise.  Women's hands are typically more avian, and I feared that I would need to clutch this pen while holding my hand in a talon-like fashion, but the designers must have taken man-hands into account when putting this pen into production.  Bravo, designers!  Although, I must say that due to the colors available, I still don't think I'd be comfortable using this pen in a public setting.  When I'm in the smoking lounge, on the golf course, or driving about town in my Corvette, I'll still use my reliable Cross Gilford, or a Uni-Ball at least.  But, if your pen was available in a highland plaid or sleek polished metal design, I'd keep one in my breast pocket for emergencies.  Well done, Bic, you've taken another meaningful step forward for the fairer sex, and speaking on their behalf, they are grateful.",ReadySetGoBoom

She caught me one time writing out a shopping list using a little rose number matching the pink ribbon I frequently wore, which everyone assumed I wore because of my concern about breast cancer. She took the kids for a couple of days and cried to her mother. I tried to quit but couldn't. She would find me coming out of the bathroom with a stack of paid bills and she knew. I had a regular man's pen with me to try to hide it, but I couldn't lie to her. We did couples' counseling and worked through it. Basically, she came to understand my need to feel the silkiness of the tones in the BIC Cristal. We discussed the issue with both of our parents. Her father and my father had a tough time understanding and still keep a little bit of distance from me. The kids still don't know, because we just don't trust that the teasing wouldn't be incessant.

It corrected all my spelling and grammar mistakes, and dotted all the ""I""'s with little hearts! I was trying to write a note to my buddy, Trent, that I stopped by to help him fix his radiator and he should call me when he got home. Instead, this stupid pen wrote that I really appreciated his friendship and he should call me so we could go shoe shopping and get mani/pedi's later. It even signed the note: ""Your Bestie"".

I truly hope that they will soon be able to introduce a line of these pens with a color changing feature so that others will know when I have PMS and stay the hell away from me! I was pleased to discover that they are waterproof, but disappointed at the lack of battery compartment and proper instructions. Apparently, they have gone well beyond the standard Bic expectations and have stimulated everyone's FLAIR for creative writing. I wonder what products Flair will come out with for people who live ""alternative lifestyles""? After all, they generally have more FLAIR than the rest of us, right? I hope the marketing geniuses at Bic have learned a valuable lesson when marketing products using outdated gender stereotyping.

By the end I was weaping uncontrollably, started to wonder how I made other people feel when I ripped their papers to shreds as a peer reviewer; and by the end of the day I decluttered our house so my wife would feel more at home, paid attention to a colleague's *feelings* (I think that's the right word) and took a shower.

I love it! I use it to write grocery lists, cotillion invitations, and to put little X's down the side of my hallway - no longer will I get lost every time I venture forth from the kitchen! I'm also learning the Standard Ladies' Alphabet (vowels only, none of those scarily pointy consonants).  I am only giving 4 stars because while holding this pen I almost accidentally voted, which gave me an attack of the vapours.

I thought it would be a nice gift to show I recognize them as women and that their gender is welcome at the workplace.  When I showed up that morning all the broads were real cheery and nice, but after I gave them their packages of BIC Crystal for Her pens everything changed.  They started to act strange and huddle up and whisper to one another. Whenever I would come around to talk to them they would just give me blank stares.  I asked one of the girls if they liked their gift and she told me ""Yeah, they are swell"", but then she rolled her eyes at me.  I am not sure what it is about these pens, but I would recommend not gifting these. They make women act weird.  Maybe it was because I gave all the gals the same gift.",Felix_Merriweather

I touched the black tip, and it smudged black paint onto my finger. At first, I was upset. What a mess! But then I got an idea. I could smudge the paint onto other surfaces as well. I tried many surfaces throughout my home. It worked well on the walls, inside my husband's books, and on some fabrics. Before I knew it, I was smudging this black paint all over the place. I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with the black color, but the freedom of it all was incredible. I even began recreating the letters that I use on my computer. I'm still practicing my technique, but I think that I'll soon be able to write my maid a check for her years of service. She's been asking for quite some time. What I really like is that I'm able to create virtually any shape I can imagine. I've been creating small, simple pictures to represent my feelings and experiences.

Then one day I noticed all of the boys getting promotions had something special.  Something powerful.  A tool that was very mysterious and forbidden to the girls in the office.  This tool I believe was what one calls a ball point pen.  Very sinister in nature and when the boys pulled it out to sign our checks, black and angry blue lines came out. Then a friend sent me the link to this website and said that girls can have the same power as men and it was in this tool called BIC Cristal for Hell.....I mean for her!

I started jotting down little notes to myself about the womanly chores I had to do when I went home after work.  You know the kind of chores that women do, taking out the trash, chopping down trees for fuel, it's going to be a long cold winter.  That sort of stuff.",Linda Lou

509,5.0 ,15 Apr 2013,"BIC Cristal For Her Ball Pens were the catalyst for the most major self actualizing moment in my life.  Growing up in a rural mining town, I was expected to get married, have babies, and only speak when spoken to.  While waiting in the checkout at the local SuperValu, I noticed the woman ahead of me was writing a check with a BIC Cristal For Her Ball Pen.  Amazement struck me.  Perhaps, if an enormous company like Bic believed that a woman was good enough for her own pen, maybe I, as a woman, just might be good enough for other things as well.  The BIC corporation believed in the power of my femininity, and for the first time I felt as though I could make something of myself.  I am now in med school, and as long as BIC continues to make Cristal For Her Ball Pens, I will know that I have someone in my corner.",Med Student

531,5.0 ,11 Jan 2013,"It has been said ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" as far back as the mid 1800's. At that time the pen is, obviously, exclusively the province of males - unwieldily and delicate quills that had to be kept out of reach of women (lest they become tainted with knowledge or impure ideas about tickling). Illustrations from the early 1900's show the design of the newer, fountain pen is clearly also inappropriate for women, being far too phallic and obviously capable of tempting the weaker sex to sin. Truly a mighty tool, the modern ball pen is, and has been for decades - but now thanks to this innovative technological emasculation, women can now handle these impressive instruments without fear or revulsion... and without concern as to whether the pen is leaking in their trousers, maybe causing an embarrassing problem!

Now, feminist standard-bearer Bic (whose Silky Touch 3 razors were welcome in my home only because they made my woman's legs smooth for my comfort) has given them the tools to create a world where women can make their high, squeaky voices heard!  Now that women have a pen that will fit in their grease-pocked, baby-scented, cooking hands, how will we keep them from communicating amongst themselves?  Imagine packs of women roaming the streets writing down all the things they find undesirable, or just icky.  Oh, the ""equal pay"" whining we'll have to endure!

Sure, it started with her asking for simple things like a mortar and pestle (until now, my wives had ground spices with their knuckles), but before I knew it she was demanding to be shod!

Now with this fantastic product each of my nine wives has her on pen to keep up with the calender on when we have play time as well as recording the birth dates of our 347 children.  Also since seven of my wonderful spouses are pregnant they can all keep up with due dates for the new babies!,toadknocker
570,5.0 ,29 Aug 2012,"I was so excited when I first saw this product!  It has filled a void in my life that had always been there but that I never quite understood.  Over the years I have tried desperately, almost ravenously to fill that emptiness - but, alas, to no avail.  I'm almost ashamed to list the things I did in my wild, deluded attempts at finding fulfillment...cigarettes, crazy hallucinogenic drugs, tattoos and piercings, kinky, wanton sex.  Why, I almost found myself enjoying the Republican National Convention!!  That's how misguided I had become!  But then THIS product came along and I finally realized what I had been missing all my life.  In essence, this IS the true meaning of my life...small, easy-to-grip, colorful, feminine pens!!  I'm weeping in my joy!  Now I can give up all my despicable vices (well, maybe except for the sex - I kinda got into that).  Now I can look my young nieces in the eye and share my message of salvation.  Are there any plans in the works to make ""training"" pens for those awkward ""tween"" years?  Something to ease their transition into full-blossomed womanhood?  Please make it so, BIC!  And since I unexpectedly find myself ""with child"", could you also make a fetal-sized set of Pens for Her?  Something easy to insert and equally easy for a still-forming female hand to grasp?  It's never too early for her to start keeping her womanly diary...in every color of the rainbow!  Thanks BIC!!",AnnaB

They confirmed that while it isn't encouraged, it is indeed legal.  They warned me about what I was getting myself into and sent me some very helpful instructional pamphlets.

I accidentally took this pen from my ""female"" co-workers desk and had been using it for several hours before I realized the mistake. Now my penis is clearly missing. I'm not sure if it fell off or what exactly happened. I'm too afraid to examine it more closely and I hate to go to the emergency room. Those waiting times are horrid. Anyway, seeing as how my penis is clearly gone, I'm terrified to go and attempt to retrace my steps as it may have become detached and fallen on the ground somewhere between my home and work. Most of my neighbors walk their dogs in the same direction and the thought that it was a tasty treat to some critter worries me so. I can assure you that it would indeed be a tasty treat as I treat my penis with care. I even moisturize it nightly, but I digress. I have no solid proof that my missing penis is due to using the Bic Pen ""for Women"", however, it's the only thing that seems logical to me as my penis is usually safely and securely attached to me and I certainly wouldn't forget to take it with me. I plan on writing Bic and sternly asking them to at the least, put an exclamation mark and capitalization on the name, so that it reads, ""Bic Pen ""FOR WOMEN!""

I am having the hardest time finding a pocket protector that does my pens justice. How hard can this be? Something this elegant needs just the right amount of Bling to show them off properly.

636,5.0 ,29 Aug 2012,"I had always questioned my sexuality. Even in middle school, I found myself looking at other boys in the locker rooms, never knowing how to talk to them about sports. I knew I was supposed to date girls, but every time I tried to force myself to touch one I wanted to vomit. Fast forward to this week. I was baking sugar cookies with my closest female friend, while listening to the Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys. We decided to play a game of MASH to predict our future partners, living situation, and automobiles. I grabbed my friends pen and began writing out the game, when all of a sudden she started screaming and tried to grab the pen from me! I had no idea what was going on, but holding the pen felt so right that I didn't let it go. I wanted to cry, my emotions were going full blast and I had never felt so right. She explained to me that it was a BIC For Her Pen, and that as a straight male I shouldn't even go near it for fear it would burn my skin and make me switch genders. But I didn't feel that way at all! And that is when I finally figured it out: I am gay. That is why I could touch it, why I wanted it near me. Why I had never felt at peace with myself before. I am so thankful for this BIC For Her Pen for finally being able to tell me the truth about myself. It's now the only pen my boyfriend and I will ever use!!",Nina

Imagine my delight when, while searching for some feminine hygiene spray, I happened upon this pen! It's everything I've ever wanted. My only complaint is that the ink is black - although it matches well with my LBD and pearls, it masks the fact that I have a vagina. It does, however, come in handy when signing my husband's name - for example, on birthday cards to relatives, credit card receipts (of course, only with his permission!) and ""surprise"" bouquets that he sends me on our anniversary when I call the florist and order them.

You see, over the past six months we've built our own furniture (using metal screws, coarse sandpaper, heavy mallets and various other brutish woodworking supplies from the well-stocked man cupboard in our kitchen); we've eaten medium rare steaks while watching Die Hard, and on separate occasions we have each changed a fuse to a major electrical appliance while listening to a 'June Carter free' Johnny Cash playlist.

With this pen, I can pretend to know all the troubles of womanhood AND get my writing done. Thanks, Bic. I rated this at only 4-stars because Bic doesn't have an option for those of us who are a bit more technologically savvy. I'm really hoping a Bic Keyboard is on it's way.

While the stigma of transgender penmanship has continued to be a concern to more conservative citizens, this instance calls for acceptance of a relatively progressive approach in an effort to improve standards of safety, education, and overall well-being in our communities.

I progressed up to solving quadratic equations and the ball point started to ""stick"" so that I couldn't solve the problem completely. Imaginary numbers? HA! It was as if I had a pen with imaginary ink! As I moved into problems with Taylor Series, the pen started to get uncomfortably warm.

Informing her that this was the only female-friendly pen on the market and she should be thrilled to be one of only 2 or 3 million women lucky enough to have these pens.  Using examples like ""writing down recipes"" and ""list of things to clean around the house"" and ""things you wish to speak to me about when given permission"", I named off several plausible uses for these instruments of communication.  I quickly found out however that these pink Bic's could also be used as a weapon as she instantly obtained the ninja-like ability to throw these with ""pen-point"" accuracy at parts of my body.  One pen missed me, and as the cap fell off in mid-air, hit the wall behind me and put a pen mark on it.

Also, the Cristal holds less ink and is not refillable. It's okay as a supplemental tool, but it doesn't compare to what she's used to. Definitely no stiff competition.",Jef 1f

Trying to match the awesome jesture of season tickets on our wedding anniversay, the next week I thought I would get her a gift.  I browsed furs, jewelry, lingire, mops and vacumes.  But when I saw these pens, it said it right on the package this was the gift that was FOR HER.  She was speechless when she revcived them.  She seemed to have a hard time containing her emothions.  She spoke strange words at high volume.  But since then she has had strange side effects.  It started innocent enough, not enough meat on the sammich, eye contact while making love.  But then for some reason she started feeling empowered by them.  Leaving the kitchen, speaking before being spoken to, wearing shoes.  But it was just too much she started making crazy suggestions about going back to college and working on a career.  Do woman even know what that means?  Anyway.  If you want them to be far more mouthy, but use their mouth a lot less, get them these pens.",justsayin
700,1.0 ,30 Aug 2012,"Whomever designed this BIC obviously had no idea what we ladies look for in a BIC.  After all, who has ever turned to her sweetheart and suggested, ""I wish your BIC had an elegant design""?  When has a woman ever wanted a BIC with a barrel thin enough to fit into her hand?  I also would be surprised to meet a woman who desired a BIC dyed pastel colors or one with only a solitary ball.  As a matter of fact, this BIC is much too thin and slippery for the ladies, and is therefore practically useless.  There is only one benefit to the design--the cap.  All ladies know that caps are essential to BICs, and far too many come without them, forcing us to provide caps ourselves.  The cap, of course, prevents the BIC from leaking into undesirable locations.  Therefore, I suggest the designer keep the cap on the BIC, but otherwise start over from scratch.  In its present state, it is an insult to women everywhere.",XX

It was like a breath of fresh air to see lady colored pens. For once, I don't have to grip a giant, man-sized pen just to sign receipts at Saks. And the ink just hits the paper so smoothly, not at all like the rough, gritty man ink in Bic's normal pens. My only complaint is that they are a bit finnicky.

All my life I have had a poem in my heart and a story in my head just yearning to be put onto paper.  But alas this wish could never be.  You see, I was born with a cursed vagina, fragile hands, and a feeble mind.  When I did break down and put pen to paper I had to rely on heavy pens that were designed for men. My fingers screamed under the weight of the mighty male pen, but that was nothing compared to the self-loathing that came with every stroke of the pen.  I knew this was an unnatural act, in my soul I knew women were not meant for scholarly pursuits such as writing. Having to use a men's pen drove that point home every time. Thanks to Bic this shame and self-hatred is no more.  For they have designed a product that is specially designed for silly female ramblings.  When a man buys me one of these pens I am free to write till my hearts content.  Not only can I write, I can also doddle.  I have reams of paper covered in drawings of unicorns, hearts, and flowers!  What was once a sin against nature is now possible thanks to Bic's altruistic invention of a pen made for women.  I no longer have to make my grocery lists under the cover of dark, I am free to write anywhere!  My daughters will be able to attend school now thanks to this most wonderful of inventions.

I was also somehow able to estimate to the minute how long it had been since I last showered, eaten chocolate, or spoken to my best friend who I hated in high school. But perhaps the most amazing thing I gained was a incomprehensibly vast library of every birthday of every single person I had ever met or thought about.

After several minutes of awkward maneuvering just to get the pen into a decent writing position, the ink would not leave the pen once I put it down on paper.  Regardless of how much shaking, dry scribbling, and even a little touch with a lighter, the ink simply refused to exit the pen, leaving me without anything on my paper.  Exasperated, I asked my girlfriend if she had another pen, and she offered me a crayon, which worked fine in a pinch, but didn't help my frustration.

Me and Nicky were out clubbing the other day with Greasy Bear and we saw that skanky hippy girl who shall not be named (but it rhimes with 'Micole' if that gives you a clue).  Anyways, we saw her and she was looking all googly eyed or whatever at Joel and Greasy Bear said ""We should poke her stupid ugly eyes out."" I was like ""Yeah!  That's hot!""  First I tried one of the pens the waiter had, but when I threw it, the yucky fat tube went all crooked and it got caught in Lo-Ho-Han's weave.  But whatever.  Luckily, I remembered that I had just stolen one of these Bic pens from a blind homeless lady I saw on the street.  It proved to be much more aerodyanmicalacious than a regular pen. I shot it dart style and it soared like a beautiful angry pointy swan all the way across the dance floor.  And guess where it landed???In that anorexic hoochie's eyeball!  Me and Greasy Bear literally DIED laughing!!!!  I was like ""Oh my god!"" and he was like ""No you didn't!""  But I did!  I just about peed my panties, except I wasn't wearing any.

One hour and 3 stores later we pull into the biggest strip mall on the other side of town (dangerous and creepy after 5pm) and push our way into Target. Curses! Sold out Again!  Why not order them from Amazon the snarky help desk girl says? Because our husbands won't allow us to buy things on the internet I snap. Shirley suggests calling Margaret, a fellow club member, and have her order them. She shops on that internet all the time. I remind Shirl that Margaret's husband Jim took her computer away after he found out she joined some Shades of Grey chat room. What were we to do? Howard had already pulled the silver and pink foil Christmas trees down from the attic two months early (grumpily I might add). With one last stop at the WalMart across the highway we found a cristal mine!  We stuffed the back seat and trunk of my '95 Ford Contour with 10 cases of these remarkable pens and sped home.

The resulting goo might do for a batch of banana bread or banana pudding - perchance a banana smoothie - but I was in no such mood (said mood made all the fouler by the unappetizing outcome of this second test). I can only conclude the the ""engineers"" that designed this product never even earned their Musaceae Mechanics degrees. For now, I can only hope that some day a product will emerge that will provide me with the smooth, even banana slices that even as I pen this missive I so crave. Please. Please.",Amazon Customer

The idea that women, who have entered the work force in droves since the 1970s, should have to use the same writing implements as their male counterparts has only contributed to woman's sense of loss of her natural femininity and her identity, her rightful place in society.  I hope that these new pens will contribute to women's understanding that they do not need to compete with men.  They should not compete with men!  These pens have the potential to reverse dangerous cultural trends that led to the disintegration of the family, men's insecurities, and women's neglect of their homes.

Assuming, as one would, that they were manufactured and tested by my childhood hero and teaching mentor, Ms. Delores Umbridge, I was quite dissapointed when they did not perform the expected function based on thier appearence. When given to a delinquent student to write with, the only thing to appear was ink on the parchment! Where were the cuts, the screams, the lasting scars? How am I supposed to teach the proper use of witchcraft and wizardry, without an effectively terrifying and painful writing utensil? I suppose it will be useless to worry about the ""witchcraft"" part, since female witches are soon to be outlawed. In these troubled times, women are not thought of as strong enough to use magic properly, nor smart enough to decide when and how to use it and for what purpose. Plus all that lady voodoo havin babies stuff is some seriously dark magic! This new edict will go into effect with the reign of our new Minister of Magic, Mett Romley, whom Ms. Umbridge supports fully despite her need to relinquish her powers and looks to him for guidance in her own helpless spells. Despite all this flibergidibit, these pens not only DO NOT cause harm or instill fear in my students, but they cause (especially in the female ones) a great surge of giddiness, distraction and joy.

Beautiful, literate, intelligent, classy. Not only could I write, men also found me attractive. Women talked behind my back, wanting to be me. My new boyfriend confided something to me this morning. He said: ""I was very suspicious of your sexual orientation and general peace of mind when I would see you writing with my pens, and all those intelligible squiggles you made! I'm glad you are educated and sure of yourself now, because I was about to break up with you"" Can you believe that?",Stephany

At first it was going great. However, about a week later my brother came over for a visit.  He needed to jot something down, so he picked up one of these pens.  Suddenly I heard a scream of pain and I rushed over to see what was wrong. I'll never forget the sight of him, eyes wide, body twisting unnaturally, clawing at his own shirt and howling like a wild animal in excruciating agony.  And then his body started to change. His chest expanded. His hair suddenly got long, as did his eyelashes. His features became more feminine.  ""W-what happened?!"" He said when he could finally speak, but it came out in a dainty, womanly tone. I have no brother anymore thanks to these pens - he's permanently altered! There wasn't even a warning on the label!  Buyer beware!",Rita

He was a wealthy entrpepenur with a devilish smile, eyes the color of the sea, and with the physique of an Adonis. We fell madly in love but I had some misgivings because he was moody, mysterious and slightly menacing. One day he took me to a secret room in his mansion on a cliff over looking the sea. He opened the door with a wolffish smile and told me he wanted me to use something he had bought especially for me but it had to be our secret as no one could know he bought it for me. The room was dark and smelled of leather and overhead I heard a slight metallic clinking. Imagine my shock and delight when he opened a maghagony box and took out a dainty pen in a sweet pastel color. The room begin to spin and my heart raced as I took the pen from his long, well manicured but very manly fingers, it was then I knew I belonged to him.",Janesoright

I gasped with joy at the sight of the gentle, delicate curves of its exquisite design and the purple jewel tones of its tip and flowery design. As I had been coveting this glorious pen for awhile, I could not wait to put this pen into my hands and glide it elegantly across paper. My hand shook in anticipation as I reached to pick it up. The pleasure of using this pen was so much more than I could ever imagine. It was complete ecstasy. Writing will never be the same with this pen.

Curious about the product but shamed by the stigma that would come with purchasing it in a store I took to Amazon.  Thankfully all Amazon packages come in plain brown boxes so none of my nosey neighbors were able to snoop and I was able to receive my new pens with the desired discretion.  I was amazed by the comfort I felt by the slender contours and the possibilities seemed endless.  The only drawback is that with the feminine colors I am not able to use this pen at work.  Have you guys ever considered making a BIC Cristal For Her... For Him?  Or even if you could just make a unisex pen that everyone could use without fear of embarrassment.  I suppose until then my beautiful new pens will be reserved for the private pages of my diary.,John Doe

Women are soft majestic creatures and would prefer a soft felt tip style pen. If women were interested in balls, we would buy the BIC for him pens.

1282,3.0 ,06 Sep 2012,"After reading many of these dazzling reviews of the Bic for Her pens, I needed to know what the hype was all about. I purchased a 16-pen package at my neighborhood Five Below for the whopping sum of $2.00 (plus tax, of course)! When I took the first pen out of the package - a blue one - I had an immediate flashback to my high school and college days and my frequent purchases of dozens of original 19-cent blue Bic Cristal pens.  That's what they sold in the ""student store"" of my high school, and I usually had less than a dollar in my wallet.  And they did ""write first time, every time.""  Now this new Bic for Her - sadly, the cap is clear (not solid blue like my Bics of yore), the pen is slimmer and lighter in weight which I hope is not because there is less ink inside?  About the colors: purple, pink, blue, green, and - what is that fifth color supposed to be - red/orange?  Good thing there were only 2 of those in my package - that color is definitely not for a Her.  The pink is the prettiest and I am glad that there were 4 pink ones in my package!:)  If these are truly ""for Her"" I would suggest that the package contain only pink and purple pens, 6 of each.  That would discourage the men in my life from taking my pens.  Ha-ha!  And about the name, Bic for Her.  Sounds like a feminine protection product.  But I bet ""Bics for Chics""  failed on the marketing table.  I would have adored the girly colors (pink and purple) and the slim barrel when I was 14 and I had smaller hands and nimbler fingers (years of practicing piano), but since I broke my wrist 6 years ago and some arthritis has set in, I much prefer those chubby pens with the comfortable rubber grip that come with advertising on them. Oh, but I did actually USE one of these new Bics - I wrote my rent check with a green pen - and it performed just fine.  And I gave a pen to my assistant for her birthday today - she picked a purple one.  I guess I will put the remaining 15 in the pen holder that my daughter made in Brownies from an orange juice can to display the Bics and share them with clients.  Perhaps then the Bics will sprout pretty flowers or something... for Her, you know.  At any rate, my price of 16 Bics for $2.00 makes them 12.5 cents each (13.125 cents if I count the sales tax). Today, a better bargain than the original 19-cent Bic even without considering a 622% inflation rate!  (I swear that all this is true and I am not making any of it up!)",CPA Chic

After all, this is America. So, I decided to make like any good objectivist and think logically about the problem of not wanting to get pregnant and then solve it myself. Thankfully I found these and they have been such a blessing. The hygenic cap is sturdy and easy to remove and replace. The small, flexible tube was somewhat difficult to insert under the skin of my arm. I think this was because of the fairly blunt safety tip. I really had to work at it to get it under the skin, but, like I said, this is my responsibility, no matter how difficult it is, so I just slammed it into my arm without any help from the government. A few bandages and some gauze later and it's getting more comfortable every day. And, I don't know why those angry feminists complain about how much contraception costs. If each implant lasts for three years then this is a 18-year supply is only about $11 including shipping!

Luckily, my husband handles everything for me, and I would most certainly be lost without him.  Recently, he came across the BIC Cristal For Her Ball Pen while doing some temporary work at the nearby women's college.  He told me it was like daycare there (which made me sympathize for their husbands because I've heard college is expensive), and the male staff really helped the women out by teaching them valuable college level knowledge such as writing.  But working as an engineer, a scientist, a journalist, and a politician at the college, my husband noticed that it was only possible for these women to learn the complicated practice of writing because of these women pens which were brilliantly designed by men.  I believe you just hook up the pen to your uterus, and the pen does the rest for you!  It is quite an amazing product, and ever since my husband gave me my very own, I have put it to good use.  Now I can create shopping lists, start a diary, and write home ec. textbooks.  My only complaint is that one time when I was writing down a casserole recipe which had some measurements in it, the pen interpreted the recipe as mathematics.

It is one thing to make a purple or pink pen; it is entirely another to imply that a woman needs a certain colour of writing instrument or else she is not a woman, that she is less than that. The commercial is even worse, it implicitly states that the type of man all women choose is the type that degrades and abuses her. As a college student, writer, artist and aspiring teacher I hereby swear that I shall never purchase or use another item produced by Bic and that I will encourage everyone I meet and know to do the same up until Bic pulls these misogynistic brands from market and advertisement, and shows genuine remorse in apologizing for trying to get away with this crap in the first place. Maybe when they realize how little self-esteem their daughters have, how few real chances they are given to succeed in life as anything other than as objects, and sexual ones at that, it might just occur that they were partly to blame. Maybe when she brings home her abusive boyfriend and refuses to leave him because ""he treats her the way she deserves"" (though I wish that feeling on no one), maybe then they might have a change of heart if their ego doesn't stand in the way.
